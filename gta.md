    * Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road"
    * Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight"

The game is built using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and Series S. So "high" and "ultra" resolution playback has crisp visuals to look like a movie.

The estimate is for 300-400 hours to go through the whole game.

The game is set within an immersive, gritty urban world.
The game has the look from "Miami Vice" TV series from the 1970s.
Like the real Miami, Florida, "Vice City", in the fictional state of US state of Leonida,
has pastel color and neon-filled streets of palm trees and bars filled with scantily-clad partyers.
Vice City was previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997) and was the main setting of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (2006).

The setting includes other Florida:
the Everglades, and the Florida Keys, Ambrosia, Mount Kalaga National Park, and Port Gellhorn.

Missions have players driving fast cars hauling weapons to safehouses.

As with other games, players are given a way to obtain guns, vehicles.

Heists
Guns shoot

Field of View (FOV) of 80-100 degrees for peripheral vision 

The game has Vibration/Force Feedback to feel the impact of car crashes and intense moments.


## Satire

People will be quoting lines from the film.

* Music
* Immersive 
* Every movie poster in the background is a twist on real film titles. 
* Graffiti and street art that hint at past Rockstar games or viral moments.
* Mission names reference classic lines from action movies. 


## Characters

The protagonist (Main Characters) are 20-something Bonnie and Clyde–inspired characters
Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos (a Latina woman).

"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."

At time of writing, rumors are that Jason wants to change the course of his life within the police, while Lucia aspires to lead an important drug cartel.

Other characters include: 
* Cal Hampton, Jason's paranoid friend; 
* Boobie Ike, who runs a business empire in Vice City; 
* Dre'Quan Priest, owner of the record label Only Raw Records with Boobie; 
* Bae-Luxe and Roxy, a musical duo signed to Only Raw under the name Real Dimez; 
* Raul Bautista, a seasoned bank robber; and 
* Brian Heder, a longtime drugrunner and Jason's landlord.
