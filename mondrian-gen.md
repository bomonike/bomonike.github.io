<a name="TheProgram"></a>

I created the program at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/python-samples/blob/master/mondrian-gen.py">https://github.com/wilsonmar/python-samples/blob/master/mondrian-gen.py</a>
to assemble all the various Python coding tricks and API calls together, in <a href="#workflow">one workflow</a>, in <strong>one program file</strong>, as the basis for being prepared to "do anything" during hackathons and MVP creations, <strong>quickly yet securely</strong>.

Thus, this is intentionally a rather "bloated swiss army knife" monolith.
However, in the future, utility functions here can be
moved to a separate file (Python module) of custom utilities.
But they are together here now to make it easier to understand and modify.

## GenAI

Currently, this program has both local programming and Generative AI (GenAI) API calls to create (from text prompt) a PNG image file of art in the "pure abstract Neoplasticism style"

This is to see how the different ways of creating horizontal and
vertical lines of rectangular boxes filled with primary colors
compare with the intuitive beauty of works manually created by Mondrian himself.


## Why Mondrian?

I came to generate my fake art in Piet Mondrian style because it seemed easy to create his style in computer code: rectangular blocs with sharp corners and filled with primary colors.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186942/Mondrian-21_ig4bxv.jpg"><img width="300" alt="Mondrian-21.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186942/Mondrian-21_ig4bxv.jpg" /></a>

While impressionists were painting soft landscapes, Piet Mondrian started a new movement of abstract art with his "21" in 1921. It presents as logical and simple for people who liked things orderly.

When I was learning websites in the late 1980's, I wrote a Java program that created random Mondrian-styled images. Recently, I rewrote it in Python, which generated images like this:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738291361/mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art_xaz6ef.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738291361/mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art_xaz6ef.png" /></a>

## Astonished

When GenerativeAI burst on the scene in 2022, I thought it would be interesting to write prompts to see what text-to-image generators would do.
Here is one artpiece generated by OpenAI's DALL-E:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186913/20250106T113307-0700-1.keep_smvdg7.png"><img width="300" alt="20250106T113307-0700-1.keep.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186913/20250106T113307-0700-1.keep_smvdg7.png" /></a>

<strong>I was astonished of the "liberties" generator took</strong> with my prompt text. The image generated didn't have straight lines like my programmatic code would generate.

> Here is an example of how AI's LLM "fills in the gaps" of what my prompt text did not specify.

It's ability to "hallucinate" is a feature, not a bug.

If you want the same result every time, write a procedural program like your grandpa did.


## Never the same twice

That artpiece on my wall is a reminder thatAI generation is not "deterministic", meaning that every time I run the program with the same prompt, a different image is generated.

> It's a reminder to me that AI does not natively respect rules.

So I had that first image framed and hanging among on my wall as the basis for comparing others generated. I used a frame similar to another real Mondrian paining:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736178566/mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266_hceym9.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736178566/mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266_hceym9.png" /></a>


<a name="NoRules"></a>

## No rules

What would other text-to-image generators do with the same prompt?

When Qwen became available Feb 2025, I used it to generate this:

<a target="_blank" href="" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186876/mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art_cfvoot.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186876/mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art_cfvoot.png" /></a>

The above broke the "rules" of Mondrian with its broken and faded lines.
Colors are not confined between lines.

> This reminds me that AI does not natively respect rules.

## Multiple generators

My program currently makes use of these APIs:

   * OpenAI's DALL-E
   * Anthropic's Claud
   * Deep Seek Janus
   * Qwan's Qwen-1.5


<a name="workflow"></a>

## A GenAI workflow

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738990409/genai-1_zqvu5i.png"><img alt="genai-1.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738990409/genai-1_zqvu5i.png" /></a>

The above provides a sequence of <a href="#TheProgram">the program's</a> workflow.
It is a snapshot of the video created from <a target="_blank" href="https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/hdrsbe">this PowerPoint</a>.

#1 and #2 in <a href="#workflow">my workflow description</a> (in yellow) is to manually generate an API key for each service and store them securely for authenticated access by the program code.

When I don't specify a specific api service, the program rotates through them one at a time.

The CLI call is #3 in <a href="#workflow">my workflow description</a>.

I added a parameter to specify the number of images to generate with each CLI command call. I prefer to make a separate call for each image generation rather than specifying it in the request to the API. This is so that I can control the file name for each image generated.


### Time and Dates

The program begins with capturing time stamps at the earliest possible moment.

Several different ways and modules have been used for time reporting.

Due to deprecations of datetime.utcnow() since version 3.12, we now use
datetime.now(UTC) to obtain a datetime object that is
“aware” of political time zones rather than “naive” ones that do not.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?timetuple=#datetime.datetime.utcnow

To ensure consistency in all logs from machines throughout the world,
we store time stamps in UTC and in 24-hour clock time.
Python, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and others use the precision of

ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss+00:00 standard format<br />
such as: 2026-02-10 12:24:40.089415+00:00

(MySQL omits the precision).
Others add "Z" to indicate the UTC time zone, which is NOT adjusted for DST (Daylight Savings Time).
Others add a time zone offset, such as the negative "-07:00" indicates a time zone West of UTC/GMT.

Presentation to users is in each user's local time zone and in AM/PM format:
coverted from UTC ed on the local time zone obtained from operating system settings, such as:<br />
    2026-02-10 12:24:40.089415 PM MST -0700



## You'll need a robot to make this

Before he died in 1944, Mondrian was working on two paintings simultaneusly:
This one he called "Boogy Woogie" (after the jazz song).

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738293479/Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024_kilwlx.webp"><img alt="Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738293479/Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024_kilwlx.webp" /></a>

This above fittingly hung in New York's Museum of Modern Art.

The work is shown above in full screen so you can see that the colorful lines were made by applying colored tape. Mondrian didn't know about then until he arrived in New York City from the Netherlands. Piet Mondrian was born in Amersfort, Netherlands 1872.

To recreate the painting, a robot would be needed to apply the colored tape to the canvas.
