<a name="TheProgram"></a>

This article describes how non-programmers can use my Python CLI AI program at:

   <ul><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/python-samples/blob/master/mondrian-gen.py">https://github.com/wilsonmar/python-samples/blob/master/mondrian-gen.py</a></ul>

to generate a collection of art pieces for monitization as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
on Marketplaces with digital contracts.

NFTs are stored (like GitHub) in blockchains of cryptographically defined addresses.
The chain of addresses provide a secure and transparent way to verify authenticity and ownership.

Because this Python program assembles many Python coding tricks and API calls together, in <a href="#workflow">one workflow</a>, it can be quickly and securely be adapted to do a full suite of tasks.

Thus, to some this may seem like a "bloated swiss army knife" monolith.
However, after team review, utility functions here will be
moved to separate Python module files.
But they are together here now to make it easier to understand and modify.


> "The printing press democratised knowledge,<br />the camera democratised images,<br />and AI is democratizing creativity itself." -- Kevin Kelly


## GenAI

Currently, this program has both local programming and Generative AI (GenAI) API calls to create (from text prompt) a <strong>PNG image</strong> file that can be printed and possibly sold as NFT art.

This workflow can be extended to other output formats:
text, audio/music, video, 3D objects for printing, synthetic data, code.

Criteria for evaluating foundation LLMs:
   * Competitive advantages
   * Incremental Investment (leveraging existing skills on AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks, etc.)
   * Cost (acquiring expertise, license fees, fine-tuning, and running models)
   * Vendor lock-in
   * Privacy & Security (private data leaked to China?)
   * Quality (hallucinations due to lack of content in the LLM's corpus)
   * Latency (does it waste your time creating or running the workflow?)
   * Biases (promoting toxic & malicious stereotypes in data used to build the model)
   * Debugging (logging, NeMo Guardrails)

Regulations around AI:
   * EU AI Act
   * US Algorithmic Accounting Act 2022
   * Japan AI regulation approach 2023
   * California Regulation of Automated Decision Tools
   * Biden-Harris Responsible AI Actions 2023 and Trump EO 2025


## Why Mondrian?

This effort is to see how the different ways of creating horizontal and
vertical lines of rectangular boxes filled with primary colors
compare with the intuitive beauty of works manually created by Mondrian himself. Some call the art style "pure abstract Neoplasticism".

I came to generate my fake art in Piet Mondrian style because it seemed easy to create his style in computer code: rectangular blocs with sharp corners and filled with primary colors.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186942/Mondrian-21_ig4bxv.jpg"><img width="300" alt="Mondrian-21.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186942/Mondrian-21_ig4bxv.jpg" /></a>

While impressionists were painting soft landscapes, Piet Mondrian started a new movement of abstract art with his "21" in 1921. It presents as logical and simple for people who liked things orderly.

When I was learning websites in the late 1980's, I wrote a Java program that created random Mondrian-styled images. Recently, I rewrote it in Python, which generated images like this:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738291361/mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art_xaz6ef.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738291361/mondrian-gen-20250119T192300-0700-1-pgm-keep-art_xaz6ef.png" /></a>


<a name="Astonished"></a>

### Astonished

When GenerativeAI burst on the scene in 2022, I thought it would be interesting to write prompts to see what text-to-image generators would do.
Here is one artpiece generated by OpenAI's DALL-E:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186913/20250106T113307-0700-1.keep_smvdg7.png"><img width="300" alt="20250106T113307-0700-1.keep.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186913/20250106T113307-0700-1.keep_smvdg7.png" /></a>

<strong>I was astonished of the "liberties" generator took</strong> with my prompt text. The image generated didn't have straight lines like my programmatic code would generate.

> Here is an example of how AI's LLM "fills in the gaps" of what my prompt text did not specify.

It's ability to "hallucinate" is a feature, not a bug.

If you want the same result every time, write a procedural program like your grandpa did.


### Never the same twice

That artpiece on my wall is a reminder thatAI generation is not "deterministic", meaning that every time I run the program with the same prompt, a different image is generated.

So I had that first image framed and hanging among on my wall as the basis for comparing others generated. I used a frame similar to another real Mondrian paining:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736178566/mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266_hceym9.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736178566/mondrian.29-compnum3-268x266_hceym9.png" /></a>


<a name="NoRules"></a>

### API don't need no stinkin' rules!

What would other text-to-image generators do with the same prompt?

When Qwen became available Feb 2025, I used it to generate this:

<a target="_blank" href="" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186876/mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art_cfvoot.png"><img width="300" alt="mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738186876/mondrian-gen-R011-20250129T120659-0700-1-qwen-art_cfvoot.png" /></a>

The above broke the "rules" of Mondrian with its broken and faded lines.
Colors are not confined between lines.

> Lookign at it reminds me that AI does not natively respect rules.

## A GenAI workflow

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1740279366/genai-1-2466x1136_qlnjlf.png"><img alt="genai-1-2466x1136.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1740279366/genai-1-2466x1136_qlnjlf.png" /></a>

### 1. & 2. Secure API Keys

#1 and #2 in <a href="#workflow">my workflow description</a> (in yellow) is to manually generate an API key for each service and store them securely for authenticated access by the program code.

When I don't specify a specific api service, the program rotates through them one at a time.

The CLI call is #3 in <a href="#workflow">my workflow description</a>.

### 2. CLI parms

I added a parameter to specify the number of images to generate with each CLI command call. I prefer to make a separate call for each image generation rather than specifying it in the request to the API. This is so that I can control the file name for each image generated.

Within a Jupyter enviornment,

### 3. Python vars

The program begins with capturing time stamps at the earliest possible moment.

Several different ways and modules have been used for time reporting.

Due to deprecations of datetime.utcnow() since version 3.12, we now use
datetime.now(UTC) to obtain a datetime object that is
“aware” of political time zones rather than “naive” ones that do not.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?timetuple=#datetime.datetime.utcnow

To ensure consistency in all logs from machines throughout the world,
we store time stamps in UTC and in 24-hour clock time.
Python, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and others use the precision of

ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss+00:00 standard format<br />
such as: 2026-02-10 12:24:40.089415+00:00

(MySQL omits the precision).
Others add "Z" to indicate the UTC time zone, which is NOT adjusted for DST (Daylight Savings Time).
Others add a time zone offset, such as the negative "-07:00" indicates a time zone West of UTC/GMT.

Presentation to users is in each user's local time zone and in AM/PM format:
coverted from UTC ed on the local time zone obtained from operating system settings, such as:<br />
    2026-02-10 12:24:40.089415 PM MST -0700

Prefect: A workflow management system that uses Pydantic for configuration and data validation.

Typer: A library for building CLI applications that uses Pydantic for argument parsing and validation.

FastAPI is a popular example of a production Python codebase that extensively uses Pydantic.
in its request and response models.

https://www.netguru.com/blog/data-validation-pydantic

A Pydantic model defines the structure and types of data expected in the request body.

Pydantic references models to automatically validate incoming data, convert it to Python objects, and generate API documentation.

### 4. .env overrrides

CAUTION: Unencrypted secrets in .env files not only exposes them to anyone who has access to your laptop, you may lose them if not backed up properly.
Coding should reference them in the User's Home folder where GitHub usually doesn't look.

However, .env files still contain plain text rather than encrypted cyphertext.

### 5. Backups

CAUTION: Unencrypted secrets in .env files not only exposes them to anyone who has access to your laptop, you may lose them if not backed up properly.

So the script automates backup before making use of the files.
On macOS, the Time Machine app is invoked. 
Alternately, a zip file can be produced for a specified folder path.

### 6. OS vars

Some APIs were written to obtain its API Key from an OS-level variable.

### 7. Sentiment analysis

The workflow includes an analysis of the prompt text for Negative, Positive, and Neutral words
based on the "VADER" rule-based database of English words downloaded locally. The "VADER" database is specifically trained for sentiment analysis in natural language.

Dashboards

Amazon Comprehend also provides Named Entity Recognition and other NLP capabilities.
TODO: detect use of inappropriate language and flag use of keywords that indicate exposure of proprietary and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) that should remain private. Amazon Macie discovers sensitive data (projects, product names, people, organizations, locations). 
Some call this feature "Leak Detection". 

Amazon Bedrock provides such safeguards, to include flagging of prompt injection attacks.

AWS SageMaker Debugger analyzes model training in real-time and offline, identifying issues and providing prediction insights. 

AWS SageMaker Clarify detects bias and explains model predictions, ensuring fairness.


### 8. DSPy Prompt Engineering

See https://bomonike.github.io/prompt-engineering/

The program uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://dspypi.org/en/latest/">DSPy</a> Python library to generate and process audio files.


<a name="multiple-generators"></a>

### 9. AI generators

The program iterates though a list of LLMs:

   * OpenAI's DALL-E
   * Anthropic's Claud
   * Deep Seek Janus
   * Qwan's Qwen-1.5

Additionally, the program iterates through each LLM a specified number of times.
This enables an entire collection to be generated in a single run.

Additional LLM APIs:
   * Sora?
   * Temporal
   * Cohere

The 2025 movie "Here" on Netflix uses AI to dynamically de-age and age faces.

INFO: Several characters, including Carrie Fisher was digitally enhanced using AI.

### 10. Media output files

The program currently outputs "lossless" .png format image files.

TODO: It can also create files that are smaller by outputting "lossy" format image files in (jpeg, webp, etc.).

TODO: Add creation of video (.mp4) format files created by <strong>Runway.ai</strong>, Suna, etc.

Adobe Firefly Video is an AI-powered tool that generates and edits video from text prompts. 
Unlike other AI video generators, Firefly is IP-safe and built for commercial use.


### 11. Evaluation

Traditionally, the effectivenss of AI is measured by "Accuracy".

When art can be generated en masse, a measure of <strong>taste</strong> or "desirability" 
is helpful to determine whether each particular item should be hoisted to certain audiences.

https://bigthink.com/mini-philosophy/the-hidden-mathematics-behind-why-you-find-things-beautiful/
Formalism holds that we can account for aesthetic judgments in non-aesthetic terms. Maybe we find a song beautiful because of its tertian harmonies, or we like a certain photo because the angular lines converge on a point.

Mozart used the Golden Ratio in The Magic Flute, as did Debussy and Bartók.
Le Corbusier used Fibonacci numbers as a kind of blueprint for building.

### 13. Encryption

Encryption also involves the creation and storage of keys used to encrypt and decrypt files.

The program can generate an symmetric key or a pair of asymmetric private and public keys.

On macOS machines, the program stores keys in Keychain app because it authenticates users.

### 18. IPFS

To physically hold files (permanently and cheaply), many blockchain enthusiasts make use of the
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) protocol to a decentralized Filecoin Network.

with smart contracts to be deployed on multiple chains like FVM, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, etc.

Files (and their metadata) would be referenced by a CID, which is a SHA256 hash of the file's contents plus https to a <strong>gateway</strong>. which provides:

    * token gated access on a public network.

A temporary gateway can be setup on any laptop.

There are several organizations that provide a <strong>dedicated gateway</strong> serving requests

   * 4K video streaming
   * automatic image resizing that reduces mobile bandwidth while increasing speed

## You'll need a robot to make this

Before he died in 1944, Mondrian was working on two paintings simultaneusly:
This one he called "Boogy Woogie" (after the jazz song).

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738293479/Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024_kilwlx.webp"><img alt="Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738293479/Mondrian_NYC-1942-991x1024_kilwlx.webp" /></a>

This above fittingly hung in New York's Museum of Modern Art.

The work is shown above in full screen so you can see that the colorful lines were made by applying colored tape. Mondrian didn't know about then until he arrived in New York City from the Netherlands. Piet Mondrian was born in Amersfort, Netherlands 1872.

To recreate the painting, a robot would be needed to apply the colored tape to the canvas.
