## Robot in space?

![ros-Robonaut2-ISS-770x578](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/133761877-fd7d01b0-9c81-4def-a644-ebcae4b7aba0.jpg)

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaigdIdLyOlAEBYj8U3camg">VIDEO</a>:
The "first human-like robot to space" went onboard the NASA STS-133 ULF-5 mission to the International Space Station "to become a permanent resident" on the orbiting spacecraft. With a pair of robotic arms and nimble hands, the humanoid robot known as Robonaut2 (<strong>R2</strong>) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Robonaut2_508.pdf">can</a> "one day venture outside the station (for EVA) to help spacewalkers to make repairs or additions to the station or perform scientific work."

> "It can lift heavy objects in space. But then, since everything is weightless, anyone can."

## Mechatronics

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OliverFoote">Oliver Foote</a> talks <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G6iwH0pn4c">Mechatronics</a> on his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OliverFoote">YouTube channel</a>

## Why ROS?

ROS (Robotic Operating System) is the <em>de facto</em> standard for robot programming.
It provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications.
It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

ROS was originally developed in 2007 at
Stanford university's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
Since 2013 it is managed by the OSRF (Open Source Robotics Foundation) at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openrobotics.org/">openrobotics.org</a> and offered free to use under open source BSD license at<br /><a target="_blank" hre="https://github.com/ros/">https://github.com/ros</a>

But in December 2022, the business of OSRC and OSRC-SG was acquired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intrinsic.ai/">Intrinsic.ai</a>, an Alphabet (Google) company that sells a the Flowstate robot developer environment.

## ROS Versions

* ROS
* ROS2 facilitates a multi-robot architecture, which ROS was not build for.
* ROS3

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a popular code-independent, human-readable format to describe the geometry of robots and their cells. It's used for collision checking and dynamic path planning. Think of it like a textual CAD description: “part-one is 1 meter left of part-two and has the following triangle-mesh for display purposes.”

## Thoughtworks Tech Radar

The influential October, 2024 publication<br />
https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/summary/ros-2
says:

"ROS 2 is an open-source framework designed for the development of robotic systems. It provides a set of libraries and tools that enable the modular implementation of applications, covering functions like inter-process communication, multithreaded execution and quality of service. ROS 2 builds on its predecessor by providing improved real-time capabilities, better modularity, increased support for diverse platforms and sensible defaults. ROS 2 is gaining traction in the automotive industry; its node-based architecture and topic-based communication model are especially attractive for manufacturers with complex, evolving in-vehicle applications, such as autonomous driving functionality."

## ROS Specs

ROS runs within Ubuntu 14.04 (not other Linux flavors).

ROS <strong>modules</strong> can be written in any language for which a client library exists (C++, Python, Java, MATLAB, etc.).

   ## Catkin

   Catkin is the ROS build system to generate executables, libraries, and interfaces.

   A CMake-based build system that is used to build all packages in ROS.

1. Build the Eclipse project files with additional build flag

   § The project files will be generated in ~/catkin_ws/build

   <pre><strong>catkin_make</strong></pre>

1. Setup a Project in the Eclipse IDE:

   <pre><strong> catkin build package_name -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPI</strong></pre>


   ### Download

1. Directly clone to your <strong>catkin workspace</strong>.

   Using a common git folder is convenient if you have multiple catkin workspaces.

1. Open a terminal and browse to your git folder

   <pre><strong>cd ~/gits</strong>

1. Clone the Git repository with

   <pre><strong> git clone https://github.com/ethzasl/ros_best_practices.git</strong></pre>

1. Symlink the new package to your catkin workspace

   <pre><strong>ln -s ~/git/ros_best_practices/ ~/catkin_ws/src/</strong></pre>


   ## Launch

1. Launch files are written in XML as *.launch files


   <a name="Master"></a>

   ## Master

   The ROS Master manages the communication between nodes.

   Every node registers at startup with the master.

1. Start a master with

   <pre><strong> roscore </strong></pre>

1. See http://wiki.ros.org/Master


   <a name="Nodes"></a>

   ## Nodes

1. Run a talker demo node with

   <pre><strong> rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker</strong></pre>
