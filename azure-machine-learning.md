## Industry Ratings

In <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-vol-24-en.pdf">PDF: 2021 Volume 24</a>, among their "opininated" recommendations of what IT technologies their clients should Adopt, Trial, Assess, or Hold, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/">Thoughtworks' "Technology Radar"</a> advised a "hold" for Azure Machine Learning, with this scathing comment:

> "We’ve observed before that the cloud providers push more and more services onto the market. We’ve also documented our concerns that sometimes the services are made available when they’re not quite ready for prime time. Unfortunately, in our experience, <strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong> falls into the latter category. One of several recent entrants in the field of bounded low-code platforms, Azure ML promises more convenience for data scientists. Ultimately, however, it doesn’t live up to its promise; in fact, it still feels <strong>easier for our data scientists to work in Python</strong>. Despite significant efforts, we struggled to make it scale and lack of adequate documentation proved to be another issue which is why we moved it to the Hold ring."

In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2023/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_28_en.pdf">PDF: 2023 Volume 28</a>, Azure Machine Learning fell of their Radar completely, but Facebook/Meta's "PyTorch" was added to the "Adopt" ring to Languages and Frameworks.

## Machine Learning Setup

<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/train-models-azure-machine-learning-cli-v2/">
LEARN: Train models in Azure Machine Learning with the CLI (v2)</a>

When "Real time" is specified, a batch process won't do and an online endpoint is needed.

There is also <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/run-component-based-pipelines-azure-machine-learning-cli-v2/">LEARN: Run (reusable) component-based pipelines in Azure Machine Learning with CLI (v2)</a>

The below is adapted from <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/deploy-azure-machine-learning-model-managed-endpoint-cli-v2/?source=recommendations">LEARN: "Deploy an Azure Machine Learning model to a managed endpoint with CLI (v2)"</a> to create a managed <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints">online endpoint</a> to make real-time predictions (inferencing).

In the LABS: https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-aml-cli/
it's about whether a customer will churn, so marketing sends out the most productive offers.
The predictions are defined in the "labels" sent back.

   </strong></pre>

1. Login the console:
1. Select the Azure subscription to use.

   <pre>az account set -s "${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"</pre>

1. Select the Azure Region.

   <pre>AZURE_REGION="eastus"
   </pre>

1. TODO: Create a Resource Group for the Principal profile with the appropriate Scope and Role for tasks below.

   <pre>AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-myco-rnd-churn-dev-001"
   # where "churn" is the project
   az group create --name "${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}" --location "${AZURE_REGION}"
   az configure --defaults group="${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}"
   </pre>

   This would be the basis for the YAML specified within the file at the end of <tt>ML_ENPOINT_FILEPATH</tt>:

   <pre>$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json
   name: mlflow-endpoint

   ### Create Workspace for ML

1. On Console, bring up "Azure Machine Learning":

   https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices%2Fworkspaces

1. Create a <strong>new workspace</strong>:

   See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-resource-organization

   <pre>AZURE_ML_WORKSPACE="ws-myco-rnd-churn-dev-001"
   az ml workspace create --name "${AZURE_ML_WORKSPACE}"
   az configure --defaults workspace="${AZURE_ML_WORKSPACE}"
   </pre>

   Based on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-workspace?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=json

   <pre>{
  "application_insights": "/subscriptions/<subscription-GUID>/resourcegroups/churn-dev-rg/providers/microsoft.insights/components/amlchurninsightsGUID",
  "description": "aml-churn-dev",
  "discovery_url": "https://eastus.api.azureml.ms/discovery",
  "friendly_name": "aml-churn-dev",
  "hbi_workspace": false,
  "key_vault": "/subscriptions/<subscription-GUID>/resourcegroups/churn-dev-rg/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/amlchurnkeyvaultGUID",
  "location": "eastus",
  "mlflow_tracking_uri": "azureml://eastus.api.azureml.ms/mlflow/v1.0/subscriptions/<subscription-GUID>/resourceGroups/churn-dev-rg/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/aml-churn-dev",
  "name": "aml-churn-dev",
  "storage_account": "/subscriptions/<subscription-GUID>/resourcegroups/churn-dev-rg/providers/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/amlchurnstorageGUID",

   ### Create compute

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-machine-learning-resources-cli-v2/4-manage-workspace-assets

   <pre>az ml compute create --name "testdev-vm" \
      --size STANDARD_DS11_V2 \
      --type ComputeInstance
   </pre>

   <pre>az ml compute create --name "aml-cluster" \
      --size STANDARD_DS11_V2 \
      --max-instances 2 \
      --type AmlCompute
   </pre>

   ### Compute Environment

   https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/assets/environment

1. Define the "basic-env.yaml" file:

   <pre>name: basic-env-ml
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - pip
  - pip:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib
    - azureml-mlflow
   </pre>

   Alternative dependencies include seaborn instead of matplotlib.

   <pre>$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/environment.schema.json
name: basic-env-scikit
version: 1
image: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04
conda_file: file:conda-envs/basic-env-ml.yml
   </pre>

   <pre>az ml environment create --file basic-env.yml
   az ml evironment list
   </pre>

   ### Create Endpoint for ML

   <pre>./doit.sh -azml -v
   </pre>

   https://learnk8s.io/templating-yaml-with-code

1. Customize for your situation:

   <pre>ML_ENPOINT_FILEPATH="./mslearn-aml-cli/Allfiles/Labs/05/mlflow-endpoint/create-endpoint.yml"
   </pre>

   with contents such as:

   <pre>$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json
name: mlflow-endpoint
traffic: 100
auth_mode: key
   </pre>

   * name: must be unique in the Azure region.
   * traffic: (Optional) Percentage of traffic from the endpoint to divert to each deployment. Sum of traffic values must be 100.
   * auth_mode: Use key for key-based authentication. Use aml_token for Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication.
   <br /><br />

1. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/online-endpoint">az ml CLI commands</a>:

   <pre>az ml online-endpoint create --name "${ML_ENDPOINT_NAME}" \
      -f "${ML_ENPOINT_FILEPATH}" ./mslearn-aml-cli/Allfiles/Labs/05/mlflow-endpoint/create-endpoint.yml
   </pre>


   ### Deploy ML Model

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoints#understand-the-scoring-script

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints?tabs=endpoint%2Cstudio

1. Customize for your situation:

   <pre>ML_ENPOINT_FILEPATH="./mslearn-aml-cli/Allfiles/Labs/05/mlflow-endpoint/mlflow-deployment.yaml"
   </pre>

1. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/online-endpoint">az ml CLI commands</a>:

   <pre>az ml online-deployment create --name "${ML_DEPLOY_NAME}" \
      --endpoint "${ML_ENPOINT_FILEPATH}"\
      -f "${ML_DEPLOY_FILEPATH}" \
      --all-traffic
   </pre>

   with contents such as:

   <pre>$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineDeployment.schema.json
name: mlflow-deployment
endpoint_name: churn-endpoint
model:
  name: mlflow-sklearn-model
  version: 1
  local_path: model
  model_format: mlflow
instance_type: <a target="_blank" href="https://azureprice.net/vm/Standard_F2s_v2">Standard_F2s_v2</a>
instance_count: 1
   </pre>

   * As for Model files stored on local path or registered model: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html"><strong>pickle (.pkl)</strong> file</a> which contains Python object serialization.

   * <tt>model_format: <a target="_blank" href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html">mlflow</a> is an industry-standard format for packaging machine learning model files in different “flavors” for use in a variety of downstream tools (real-time serving through a REST API or batch inference on Apache Spark).

   * QUESTION: With a <strong>MLflow model</strong>, a registered model is loaded in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. So it isn't necessary to include in the deployment the environment and <strong>scoring script</strong> which loads the pre-trained model.

   * Environment refers to all the packages (Python prerequites) needed.
   * Instance type and scaling capacity
   * instance_type: VM SKU that will host your deployment instance.
   * instance_count: Number of instances in the deployment.
   <br /><br />

   REMEMBER: Although the underlying infrastructure of endpoints are "managed" by Azure, administrators do need to define (tune over time) the rate of requests each endpoint is expected to handle. This is tricky to adjust vertical versus horizontal scaling:

   * instance_type is the Compute size (vertical scaling), which need to be adjusted over time as traffic increases or decreases. <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series">About the Fsv2 series</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://pcr.cloud-mercato.com/providers/azure/flavors/standard_f2s_v2">pricing  different across regions</a>
   * instance_count is the number of compute instances (horizonal scaling).
   <br /><br />

   ### Monitoring

1. TODO: Define monitoring and visualization to identify when to adjust:

   ### Update endpoint

   Multiple models (both green and blue) are deployed to an endpoint for blue/green deployments so transition to a new version of the model can be gradual percentage, without interrupting service for the client.

1. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/online-endpoint">az ml CLI commands</a>:

   <pre>az ml online-endpoint update --name churn-endpoint --traffic "blue=0 green=100"
   </pre>

   ### Delete endpoint

1. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/online-endpoint">az ml CLI commands</a>:

   <pre>az ml online-endpoint delete --name churn-endpoint --yes --no-wait
   </pre>

## My Sample ML Code

PROTIP: AI-102 is heavy on questions about coding.

So samples (unlike examples) are a more complete, best-practices solution for each of the snippets. They're better for integrating into production code.

Unlike other classes, this describes the <strong>automation</strong> I've created instead of you clicking through web pages (portal.azure.com).

To start with, refer to my https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly.

## Decision service = Azure Machine Learning

By definition, "Machine Learning" involves creating programs without programmers coding logic in languages such as Python.

The work of Machine Learning (abbreviated to "ML") is to recognize patterns in historical data to "train" a <strong>model</strong> which can be referenced by web applications and other user interfaces to make <strong>predictions</strong> from new, similar data.

In Azure, several "resources" need to be setup:

   * <a href="#CreateMLWorkspace">A Machine Learning workspace</a>
   * A Storage account to hold the model
   * A Key Vault to hold secrets
   * An Application Insights account to hold logs and metrics
   * A source of data (database)
   * <a href="#DataIngestion">Ingestion</a> and cleaning of data
   <br /><br />

The above can be setup by running a single command, but after you are setup to run it.

1. First, get skill at using Azure Portal Poart and CLI Bash by following my deep but concise tutorial at

   <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/azure-onboarding/">https://wilsonmar.github.io/azure-onboarding</a>

   It covers creation of free Azure Subscription and Azure Storage accounts to hold files in a clouddrive folder.

   <a name="CreateMLWorkspace"></a>

   ### Create Machine Learning Workspace using GUI

1. In <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/">portal.azure.com</a>, press G+\ and in the Search box type enough of <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices%2Fworkspaces">Machine Learning</a> for a selection with that name to appear in the dropdown that appears so you can select it by pressing Enter.

   <img width="1042" height="286" alt="az-ml-search-mac-1042x286" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120628656-2c886300-c422-11eb-8eeb-889cf378bcc0.png">

   (Don't select "classic").

   "Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. In other words, using data to create models that can predict unknown values. It works by identifying relationships between data values that describe characteristics of something (its features) and the value we want to predict (the label), and encapsulating these relationships in a model through a training process."

   * <a href="#Classification"><strong>classification</strong></a> predicts <strong>categories or classes</strong> using <strong>unsupervised</strong> machine learning techniques to fit features into model and predict classification of the label. Labels are what we want to predict, such as a future value predicted or an action. The label is usually "Y" among mathimaticians.

   * <strong>regression</strong> predicts <strong>numeric</strong> values using <strong>supervised</strong> machine learning techniques on historical data.

   * Time Series forecasting is used for <a href="#AnomalyDetection">Anomaly Detection</a> using regression with a time-series element, enabling you to predict numeric values at a future point in time.

   * <strong>Clustering</strong> identifies the nearest neighbor in multiple dimensions, such as the nearest color to an RGB color value.

   ### Create Machine Learning Workspace using CLI

2. Setup your CLI Bash environment by following my instructions at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly#readme">https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly#readme</a>

   That covers setting up folders, shortcuts, and external memory variables in the CLI environment.

3. Invoke a run to train a sample model by running:

   <pre><strong>./az-mlcli2.sh</strong></pre>

   This script I wrote to automate manual setup procedures from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples">https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples</a>, described at  .

   The script invoke <tt>bash setup.sh</tt> to create Resource Group "azureml-examples-rg" in "East US" containing:
   * <a href="#CreateMLWorkspace">main (Machine Learning)</a>
   * maininsights... (Application Insights)
   * mainkeyvault... (Key vault)
   * mainstorage...  (Storage account)
   <br /><br />

   My script also runs a GitHub Actions yml file using the "ml" subcommand from the <a target="_blank" href="
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure/azureml-examples/azure-machine-learning-20-cli-preview-examples/">Microsoft ML 2.0 CLI Preview</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/announcing-the-new-cli-and-arm-rest-apis-for-azure-machine/ba-p/2393447">announced May, 2021</a>:

   <pre><strong>time az ml job create -f jobs/hello-world-env-var.yml --web --stream</strong></pre>

   The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/cli/jobs/hello-world.yml">code at hello-world.yml</a>, which has python print out "hello world" from within a Docker image downloaded from Docker Hub (docker.io):

   <pre>command: echo $ENV_VAR
environment:
  docker:
    image: docker.io/python
environment_variables:
  ENV_VAR: "hello world"
compute:
    target: local
   </pre>

   Information about it is at:
   https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/python-sdk/tutorials/an-introduction

1. Run again, but use hello-world-env-var.yml

1. Run other yml files listed in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli">https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli</a>, which scripts passed or failed in GitHub Actions.

   CAUTION: Don't run jobs marked "failing" (in red).

1. When done, stop billing by running:

   <pre><strong>bash cleanup.sh</strong></pre>

   Additionally, there are more <a href="SampleMLCode">sample ML code to create models</a>,

   Below are instructions to do the work manually in the Azure Portal:

...

1. Click "Start now" under "Notebooks".

   * What does <strong>NumPy.shape (2,20)</strong> tell you about the elements in the array?<br />
   A tuple whose elements give the lengths of the corresponding array dimensions.
   The array is two dimensional, with each dimension having 20 elements.

1. To better study the Python coding, clone the repo to your local machine so you can use your editor's Find features.

1. Make a change and run again to see the impact.

   PROTIP: The "Ensemble Algorithm" is the current state of the art yielding the best ROC.

## Jupyter Notebooks on Azure

If you're running a Chromebook laptop, there are several ways you can now run your Juypter Notebooks within the Azure cloud:

   * Within <a href="#AzureStudio">Azure Machine Learning's Azure Studio (below)</a>

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/aznb-codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>, if you are part of the beta.

HISTORY: <a target="_blank" href="https://notebooks.azure.com/">https://notebooks.azure.com</a> is now redirecting users to other services.

<a name="AzureStudio"></a>

### ML Studio JupyterLab from local files

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/quickstart-export-jupyter-notebook-project#use-notebooks-with-azure-machine-learning">DOCS</a>:
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks">Run Jupyter Notebooks in a ML workspace</a>

1. On an internet browser, view a <tt>.ipynb</tt> (Jupyter notebook) file GitHub.com. It may take several seconds to render. For example:

   NOTE: That is adapted from <a target="_blank" href="
   https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900/blob/main/01%20-%20Image%20Analysis%20with%20Computer%20Vision.ipynb">
   https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900/blob/main/01%20-%20Image%20Analysis%20with%20Computer%20Vision.ipynb</a>
   then removing setup in Azure, so that the Notebook can be cross-platform (also work outside of Azure).

   Currently, GitHub does not provide a "run" button when displaying Notebooks.

   For that, you need to create a Cognitive Services instance on Azure, described below.

1. In a Terminal, load a GitHub repo containing notebooks and associated files:

   <pre><strong>cd ~/gmail_acct  # or whatever folder you use to hold repos to be clonned:
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900 --depth=1
   cd mslearn-ai900
   </strong></pre>

1. In portal.azure.com:
1. G+\ <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices%2Fworkspaces">Machine Learning</a>.

1. The script creates these resources under the Resource Group:
   * Machine learning
   * Application Insights
   * Key vault
   * Storage account
   <br /><br />

1. G+\ <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices%2Fworkspaces">Machine Learning</a>
1. Click the Machine Learning name just created.
1. In Portal Machine Learning: <strong>"Launch studio"</strong> (formerly "Azure Studio") to open a new browser tab "Microsoft Azure Machine Learning".

1. In the left-side navigation bar, select Author: Notebooks.
1. Click "+ Create" to Upload files.
1. Navigate thru folder "mslearn-ai900", "01 - Image Analysis with Computer Vision.ipynb".
   Select overwrite and "trust contents of this file". Click "Upload".
1. Copy to clipboard Key1 from running <tt>./az-cog-cli.sh</tt>.

1. Highlight "YOUR_COG_KEY" and paste Key1 from the script run.

1. Do the same with "YOUR_COG_ENDPOINT". ???

1. Click "Authenticate" if that appears.

1. Delete the Resource Group and Compute so charges don't accumulate.

### Create data file

The data used in the tutorial below is from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/projects/azure-machine-learning-studio-pipeline">Coursera: Machine Learning Pipeline Tutorial with Azure ML Studio</a>. The tutorial provides a file on its GitHub, so skip this data preparation step (which normally is a large part of the total effort).

Another lab is: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/deploy-model">MSLEARN "predict-rentals" LAB</a>
following https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/use-auto-ml For that, download data file from https://aka.ms/bike-rentals

Generally:

1. Select the Datasets page (under Assets)
1. " + Create", "From web files". Web URL: https://aka.ms/bike-rentals

   Alternately, you can upload a file from your local machine.

1. Dataset type: Tabular
1. Next




<a name="CreateWorkspace"></a>

### Create ML Workspace resource

1. Go to G+\ <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices%2Fworkspaces">Machine Learning</a>

   If you're following <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-azure-machine-learning-studio/">cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-azure-machine-learning-studio</a>, select the workspace created and skip to the next section.

   But if you're not following that, follow steps below:

1. Select your Directory and Subscription.
1. Click the blue "Create machine learning workspace". A new tab appears in portal.azure.com.
1. Resource Group: PROTIP: just 3 letters are necessary, so use letters (such as "devml") which does not have ascenders for making numbers to be appended to it more visible.
1. Workspace Name: PROTIP: just 3 letters are necessary.
1. Container Registry: To enesure uniqueness, append $RANDOM to your text (to make devml3232).
1. Container Registry SKU: Basic

   <img width="436" alt="az-ml-workspace-details-872x750" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120132531-bc5eb080-c187-11eb-91b2-9dbee3b3c104.png">

1. "Review + create".

   CAUTION: The network is public by default. Choosing private would entail more configuration.

1. "Create".

   CAUTION: Charges now begin to accumulate. Delete your Resource Group ASAP. It's cheaper if you recreate it if you need another workspace.

1. When created, click "Go to resource" blue button.

1. Enable SSH access: leave unchecked

1. Next and wait (5 minutes) for State to go from "Creating" to "Running".

   CAUTION: Charges now begin to accumulate. Delete your Resource Group ASAP. It's cheaper if you recreate it if you need another compute instance.


   <a name="MLDataInput"></a>

   ### ML Data Input

1. PROTIP: Instead of using your mouse to expand the assets menu hierarchy, which requires memorizing what is under each asset category:

   <img width="240" alt="az-ml-assets-menu-480x1042" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120109638-88ec3980-c127-11eb-8806-62465ccbf16d.png">

   <a name="PipelineDiagram"></a>

   get the titles of assets to drag-and-drop from this sample pipeline diagram:

   ![az-ml-pipeline-map-809x692](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120111258-77f2f680-c12e-11eb-91ac-2486dfa33d0f.png)

1. Click in the field containing "Search by name, tags and description" and type:

   <strong>Import Data</strong>

   As you type, assets matching your search phrase appear. Stop typing when you see what you want.

   ![az-ml-feature-search-637x302](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120110683-b2a75f80-c12b-11eb-834b-1af724ca1851.png)

   NOTE: The date shown is the version of the asset.

1. Drag-and-drop the asset "Import Data" onto the <strong>top</strong> of the (blank) designer canvas.

1. In the menu that appears on the right, open the "Data source" dropdown to select "URL via HTTP".
1. Copy and paste the URL to <a href="#CreateMLData">created data (above)</a>, such as this:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/azure-lab-artifacts/master/intro-to-azure-ml/tweets.csv

1. Wait until "Validating" is done. The larger the file, the longer this will take.


   <a name="Submit"></a>

   ### Submit and Run Experiment

1. Preview schema to ensure data fields are defined correctly. Save.

1. In order for Column labels to populate, click "Submit" at the uppper-right to run the model.

1. In the "Set up pipeline run" dialog, select "Create new" and type experiment name:

   PROTIP: Have a naming convention for models. Begin the Name with "dev" to denote its status. Name models with a suffix of a couple of zeros in front of number 1 in case there are several.

1. Click Submit on the dialog. Look to the upper-right for the "Running" status to "Finished", which can be several minutes.

1. Look for the "Running" status to "Finished", which can be several minutes.


   ### Add pipeline steps to filter and process imported data

1. Search for asset "<strong>feature hashing</strong>" and drag it under "Import Data" as a new step in the canvas:

   ![az-ml-feature-search-637x302](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120110683-b2a75f80-c12b-11eb-834b-1af724ca1851.png)

1. Connect two steps: click the circle under the top step (turning it green), then drag it to the circle above the second step (turning that green). An arrow should appear.

   That action converts text data into a vector of features which makes the data more manageable and performant.

1. In the context menu at the right, click "Edit column name" and select "<strong>tweet_text</strong>". Save.


   ### Split data

1. Search for asset "<strong>split data</strong>" to drag-and-drop onto the designer canvas.

1. Click on it to input "<strong>0.8</strong>" in the "Fraction of rows in the first ouput dataset" field (replacing the default "0.5"), then Tab away.

   80% - the "training set" is used to train the model.<br />
   20% - the "test set" is used to help score the model later.

1. Connect the Feature Hashing step with the Split Data step.

1. Search for asset "<strong>Filter Based Feature Selection</strong>" and drag it onto the canvas under "Split Data", then join them.

   This teases out the data by irrelevant attributes or redundant columns. Each feature column is measured and scored then ranked, which improves accuracy when building a predictive model.

1. Search for asset "<strong>Train Model</strong>" and drag it onto the canvas.

1. In Target Column: click the Edit Column link to reveal the list of columns by clicking "Edit column name" to select "<strong>sentiment_label</strong>". Save.

1. Number of desired features: 2000 (instead of default 1).

1. Feature scoring method: Select "ChiSquared" (instead of default "PearsonCorrelation").

1. Search for <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/score-model">Score Model</a>

1. Search for <strong>Evaluate Model</strong>, drag-and-drop.
1. PROTIP: Link from Score Model to the <strong>left</strong> port of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/evaluate-model#expected-inputs">Evaluate Model</a>. Otherwise there will be an error.

   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/designer-error-codes


   ### Training run

1. Verify that you've achieved the <a href="#PipelineDiagram">pipeline diagram (above)</a>.

1. Click "Submit" at the upper-right to run the whole pipeline to create a model.

   It take several minutes to complete all the steps. The more data, the longer it takes.

   ### Evaluate ML models

1. Right-click on the Evaluate Model step to expand "Visualize" before clicking "Evaluation results":

   ![az-ml-eval-open-483x255](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120210646-3f662200-c1ed-11eb-980f-300e5a2c60e3.png)

Azure does not present all the statistics, which we cover here.

#### Metrics of classification model performance

See <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/classification#Evaluation">My notes on evaulating Classification results</a>.

#### Metrics of regression model performance

See <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/regression#Evaluation">My notes on evaulating Regression results</a>.

#### Metrics for clustering model performance

* <strong>Average Distance to Other Center</strong> is how close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroids of all other clusters.

* <strong>Average Distance to Cluster Center</strong> is the closeness of all points in a cluster to the centroid of that cluster.

* <strong>Number of Points</strong> is how many data points were assigned to each cluster, and the total overall number of data points in any cluster.

   If the number of data points assigned to clusters is less than the total number of data points available, it means that the data points could not be assigned to a cluster.

* <strong>Maximal Distance to Cluster Center</strong> is the max of the distances between each point and the centroid of that point's cluster.

* If this number is high, it can mean that the cluster is widely dispersed. This statistic together with the Average Distance to Cluster Center to determine the cluster's spread.

* <strong>Combined Evaluation</strong> score (at the bottom of the each section of results) lists the averaged scores for the clusters created in that particular model.


### Comparing multiple models

   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/evaluate-model">
   To compare the performance among multiple models</a>, in your pipeline, add an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/evaluate-model">Evaluate Model</a> module and connect the Scored dataset output of the Score Model or Result dataset output of the Assign Data to Clusters to the left input port of Evaluate Model.

## Create a Real-Time Inference Pipeline and Deploy an Endpoint

   Azure Machine Learning Designer allows models to be deployed as REST endpoint to be consumed by others or an application. This is great for developers that have minimal experience in Machine Learning and want to incorporate predictive models into their application.

   The pipeline first has to be converted into an inference-pipeline and then deployed as an endpoint on either AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) or an Azure Container Instance.

1. Click "Create inference pipeline" to select "<strong>Real-time inference pipeline</strong>".

   This adds "Web Service Input" and "Web Service Output" steps in the canvas.

   ![az-ml-deploy-797x435](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/120212775-a258b880-c1ef-11eb-9e31-6336d0d7bb84.png)

1. Click "Submit". Select existing experiment name.
1. Click "Submit" on the dialog.

1. Click "Deploy" at the upper-right.

1. In the "Setup real time endpoint" dialog, with "Deploy new real-time endpoint" selected, type "<strong>tweet-analysis</strong>" into the Name field.

   PROTIP: If you share a workspace with a team or other teams, make the name unique among all who you work with.

1. Compute type drop-down: select "Azure Container Instance".
1. Click "Deploy" in the dialog.

1. Wait while "Deploy: Waiting real-time endpoint creation".

1. When "Deploy: Succeeded" appears, click "view real-time endpoint" to open another browser tab to show the web app.
