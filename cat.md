### Basic Electricity

Electricity is the flow of electrons in a conductor. It is a phenomenon whose effects are experienced through such things as heat, light and magnetism. It is said that flashlights, electric drills, motors, etc. are generally recognized as electric. However, computers and televisions are often referred to as electronic. What is the difference?
Anything that works with electricity is electric, including flashlights and electric drills, but not all electric components are electronic.

The term electronic refers to semiconductor devices known as electron devices.
Electron devices are named as such because they rely on the flow of electrons for their operation.

It is the behavior of electrons that make up electricity.
The center of an atom is called the nucleus (1) and is made up of particles called protons and neutrons.
   * The proton has a naturally positive electrical charge; the neutron is neutral.
Orbiting the nucleus are electrons (2), which have a negative charge.
Opposite electrical charges attract;
therefore, the positive charge of the proton holds the electron in its orbit.

The attraction or repulsion of electrically charged bodies is due to an invisible force called an electrostatic field. Think of the force between charged particles as imaginary electrostatic lines from the negative charge to the positive charge.

Free electron in the valence ring.

A charged battery stores an imbalance of electrical forces. If a conductor is connected to a positive and negative source, such as a dry cell battery, an electron (-) is forced out of orbit and attracted to the positive (+) end of the battery. The atom is now positively (+) charged because it has a deficiency of electrons (-). It in turn attracts an electron from its neighbor. The neighbor in turn receives an electron from the next atom, and so on until the last atom receives an electron from the negative end of the battery.
The result of this chain reaction is that the electrons move through the conductor from the negative end to the positive end of the battery. The flow of electrons continues in this direction as long as the positive and negative charges from the battery remain imbalanced.

The directional quality of the electricity based on the type of charge is called polarity.

Electron theory describes the flow of current going from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. From a purely scientific point of view, electron flow reflects the real direction in which electrons travel in a circuit.
Conventional theory describes the flow going from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. Conventional theory is a standard on which wiring diagrams are based. Therefore, in most cases, use conventional flow theory in fault diagnosis and circuit testing.''

Conventional theory describes the flow going from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. Conventional theory is a standard on which wiring diagrams are based. Therefore, in most cases, use conventional flow theory in fault diagnosis and circuit testing.

A parallel circuit is more complex than a series circuit because there is more than one path for current to flow. Because each current path (branch) connects to the same positive and negative terminal, they will all have the same applied voltage.
