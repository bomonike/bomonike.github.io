## Alternatives

To gain a higher chance for admission into top universities,<br />
to have more freedom to take classes,<br />
to take more advanced classes sooner, <br />
to graduate sooner,<br />
to build a more impressive resume for jobs,<br />
students, while still in high school, can earn college credits:

1. Take classes on-line at colleges which accept high school students:

2. Attend a nearby community college on-site within "duel enrollment" programs administered at authorized Prometric testing centers, mostly on college campuses.

3. Score high enough on credit-by-examination CLEP, DSST (DANTES Subject Standardized Tests), IB, and Cambridge AICE. Such exams demonstrate student knowledge of college-level material without having to take the full course. CLEP are accepted at nearly 3,000 institutions.

4. Score high enough on AP (Advance Placement) exams by the College Board.


## AP (Advanced Placement) for Computer Science

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.veritasai.com/veritasaiblog/https/wwwveritasaicom/8-reasons-why-you-should-take-ap-computer-science-in-high-school">VIDEO: Why you should take AP Computer Science in High School</a>

The College Board conducts <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses">exams in 38 academic subjects</a>. Each year, some exams are retired and others are added.

Within the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) category, for 2023/24 the College Board offered <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/compare-ap-computer-science-courses">two</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.collegeboard.org/difference-between-ap-computer-science-principles-and-ap-computer-science
">different</a> Computer Science AP exams:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles">"<strong>AP CSP</strong>" for the <strong>AP Computer Science Principles</strong></a> exam on the "Big ideas of computer science (including algorithms and programming)" (computational thinking and fluency).

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a">"<strong>AP CSA</strong>" for the <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong></a> exam on "Problem solving and object-oriented programming" in the Java programming language.

The College Board's exam names have a suffix "A" to designate the equivalent of a first-semester college course in a subject area. A two-semester series has a suffix of "AB" or "BC".

There was a time when there was a "AP Computer Science AB" which covered all the topics of AP Computer Science A plus more formal and in-depth study of algorithms, data structures, and data abstractions. That exam was discontinued after the 2008–2009 year.

The two exams can be taken in any order.
There are no limit on retakes.

## CSA - Computer Languages

AP Computer Science was taught using Pascal for the 1984–1998 exams, C++ for 1999–2003, and object-oriented <strong>Java</strong> since 2004 as AP Computer Science A.

<strong>Units</strong> listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-overview.pdf">pdf about the 3-hour CSA exam</a>:

   1. Primitive (Data) Types
   2. Using Objects (Methods and Control Structures)
   3. Boolean Expressions and if Statements
   4. Iteration
   5. Classes
   6. Array
   7. ArrayList
   8. 2D Array
   9. Inheritance
   10. Recursion (Computational Thinking)
   <br /><br />

PROTIP: Almost all the above concepts need to be address among all programming languages, but with different implementations.

One concern about CSA is that the programming lack the <strong>context</strong> of building a complete system, which programmers need to do.

## CSP Concepts

There exists other programming languages (Assembly, C, C#, F#, Go, JavaScript, Lua, PHP, Rust, Swift, TypeScript, Zig, etc.).

Recently, many teachers of the AP CSP exam select the <strong>Python</strong> programming langauge, which is popular among Data Scientists working with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning that's all the rage since 2023.

   <br /><br />

* Big Idea 1: Creative Development

   Understand the significance of collaboration in program development and how to use an iterative approach in your work. When developing computing innovations, developers can use a formal, iterative design process or a less rigid process of experimentation, and will encounter phases of investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. Collaboration is an important tool at any phase of development.

* Big Idea 2: Data & Analysis

   Delve into how computers handle data and how data can be utilized to generate fresh information and solve problems. Data are central to computing innovations because they communicate initial conditions to programs and represent new knowledge.

   * 3B-DA-05	Use data analysis tools and techniques to identify patterns in data representing complex systems.	For example, identify trends in a dataset representing social media interactions, movie reviews, or shopping patterns.
   * 3B-DA-06	Select data collection tools and techniques to generate data sets that support a claim or communicate information.	
   * 3B-DA-07	Evaluate the ability of models and simulations to test and support the refinement of hypotheses.	
   <br /><br />

* Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming

   Gain proficiency in utilizing algorithms and abstractions to create programs that solve problems or express your creativity.

   * 3B-AP-08	Describe how artificial intelligence drives many software and physical systems.	Examples include digital ad delivery, self-driving cars, and credit card fraud detection.
   * 3B-AP-09	Implement an artificial intelligence algorithm to play a game against a human opponent or solve a problem.	Games do not have to be complex. Simple guessing games, Tic-Tac-Toe, or simple robot commands will be sufficient.
   * 3B-AP-10	Use and adapt classic algorithms to solve computational problems.	Examples could include sorting and searching.
   * 3B-AP-11	Evaluate algorithms in terms of their efficiency, correctness, and clarity.	Examples could include sorting and searching.
   * 3B-AP-12	Compare and contrast fundamental data structures and their uses.	Examples could include strings, lists, arrays, stacks, and queues.
   * 3B-AP-13	Illustrate the flow of execution of a recursive algorithm.	
   * 3B-AP-14	Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects.	Object-oriented programming is optional at this level. Problems can be assigned or student-selected.
   * 3B-AP-15	Analyze a large-scale computational problem and identify generalizable patterns that can be applied to a solution.	As students encounter complex, real-world problems that span multiple disciplines or social systems, they should decompose complex problems into manageable subproblems that could potentially be solved with programs or procedures that already exist. For example, students could create an app to solve a community problem by connecting to an online database through an application programming interface (API).
   * 3B-AP-16	Demonstrate code reuse by creating programming solutions using libraries and APIs.	Libraries and APIs can be student-created or common graphics libraries or maps APIs, for example.
   * 3B-AP-17	Plan and develop programs for broad audiences using a software life cycle process.	Processes could include agile, spiral, or waterfall.
   * 3B-AP-18	Explain security issues that might lead to compromised computer programs.	For example, common issues include lack of bounds checking, poor input validation, and circular references.
   * 3B-AP-19	Develop programs for multiple computing platforms.	Example platforms could include: computer desktop, web, or mobile.
   * 3B-AP-20	Use version control systems, integrated development environments (IDEs), and collaborative tools and practices (code documentation) in a group software project.	Group software projects can be assigned or student-selected.
   * 3B-AP-21	Develop and use a series of test cases to verify that a program performs according to its design specifications.	At this level, students are expected to select their own test cases.
   * 3B-AP-22	Modify an existing program to add additional functionality and discuss intended and unintended implications (e.g., breaking other functionality).	For instance, changes made to a method or function signature could break invocations of that method elsewhere in a system.
   * 3B-AP-23	Evaluate key qualities of a program through a process such as a code review.	Examples of qualities could include correctness, usability, readability, efficiency, portability and scalability.
   * 3B-AP-24	Compare multiple programming languages and discuss how their features make them suitable for solving different types of problems.	Examples of features include blocks versus text, indentation versus curly braces, and high-level versus low-level.
   <br /><br />

* Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks

   Explore the functioning of computer systems and networks, as well as how multiple computers can be employed to divide tasks and expedite processes.

   * 3B-CS-01	Categorize the roles of operating system software.	Examples of roles could include memory management, data storage/retrieval, processes management, and access control.
   * 3B-CS-02	Illustrate ways computing systems implement logic, input, and output through hardware components.	Examples of components could include logic gates and IO pins.
   * 3B-NI-03	Describe the issues that impact network functionality (e.g., bandwidth, load, delay, topology).	Recommend use of free online network simulators to explore how these issues impact network functionality.
   * 3B-NI-04	Compare ways software developers protect devices and information from unauthorized access.	Examples of security concerns to consider: encryption and authentication strategies, secure coding, and safeguarding keys.
   <br /><br />

* Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing

   Analyze the ramifications of computing on societies, economies, and cultures, and contemplate the legal and ethical responsibilities that programmers bear.

   * 3B-IC-25	Evaluate computational artifacts to maximize their beneficial effects and minimize harmful effects on society.	
   * 3B-IC-26	Evaluate the impact of equity, access, and influence on the distribution of computing resources in a global society.	
   * 3B-IC-27	Predict how computational innovations that have revolutionized aspects of our culture might evolve.	Areas to consider might include education, healthcare, art/entertainment, and energy.
   * 3B-IC-28	Debate laws and regulations that impact the development and use of software.

## Why Computer Science?

Studing of Computer Science is not mutually exclusive with studying other subjects.

Because virtually all professional now use computers, even within trades, 
skill with using computer hardware and software efficiently and securely enhances success in other disciplines.

These computational thinking practices are skills students should develop during the CSP course:

   * Computational Solution Design: Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
   * Algorithms: procedures to solve problems and obtain answers
   * Abstraction in Program Development: Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
   * Code Analysis: Evaluate and test programs.
   * Computing Innovations: Investigate 
   * Responsible Computing: Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.
   <br /><br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flvs.net/high-school-courses/course/ap-computer-science-a/12/">One school</a> specified that for CSA, "Algebra 1 required. Algebra 2 and prior programming experience (i.e. Foundations of Programming) recommended." 

Students may have prior experience with Computer Science topics:
   * Turtle graphics and micro:bit in <a target="_blank" href="https://codehs.com/course/9434/explore">"Tech Apps and Coding" at CodeHS</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://codehs.com/uploads/379980882e1302b1493894153a851a2e">180 contact hours</a>) to meet Montana <a target="_blank" href="https://csteachers.org/k12standards/interactive/">CSTA 2 (Computer Science Teachers Association) standards</a> for students in grades 6-8

   <br /><br />

But the CSP exam doesn't require much math and has one of the highest passing rates (68%) and is known to be one of the easiest exams. So it's feasible to take CSP as a Sophomore.

This is why, within the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings">highest-ranked high schools in the US</a>, it's not uncommon for ambitious Sophomores and even Freshmen (9th or 10th grade) to take a Computer Science course so they have more time to take AP exams in other topics in their Junior and Senior year-end. That enables students to fully participate in extracurricula activities for a well-rounded experience.

## Fees & Dates

The exam is proctored just once at the end of each academic year, in May or early June, depending on the school test site. Late tests take place during the third week of May.

   * CSP Create performance task submission deadline is Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. local time.
   * CSP testing is Wednesday, May 15, 2024 at 12:00 PM in the afternoon local time.
   * CSA testing is Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 12:00 PM in the afternoon local time, taken as a full-length paper-and-pencil exam that students can only take in school, not virtually.
   <br /><br />

Starting in <strong>February</strong>, students register for AP Exams through the school they attend. Each school's AP coordinator collect from students in the US <a target="_blank" href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/exam-fees"><strong>$98</strong></a> USD per exam when they sign up.
The College Board provides fee reductions (to $53) for eligible students with financial need. AP Seminar or AP Research exams are $146.

Schools have until November 15 to let College Board know which students are testing.

AP scores come out about two months after the exam, during the beginning of July. 

Students who are homeschooled or go to a school that doesn’t administer AP Exams can find a school on the <a target="_blank" href="https://apcourseaudit.inflexion.org/ledger/">College Board's AP Course Ledger</a>, which lists secondary schools that have passed the AP Course Audit.

## Scores

One does not need to take a class before taking the exam. 
But almost all students do.

Results are reported on a scale from 1 to 5. Most colleges recognize a score of 3 as the basis for a student in lieu of taking the Fundamentals class. This enables the student to take more advanced classes earlier in college. AP exams can boost a student's chances of being accepted at competitive colleges.

Historically, 12% of test takers received a mark of 5 on the CSP.

The mean score for all 2023 AP Exams was 2.96. More than 60% of all exams taken earned a score of 3 or higher. 
https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores/score-distributions
AP Score Distributions.
AP Computer Science Principles, 63.1% received a score of 3 or higher.

Using <a target="_blank" href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/getting-credit-placement/search-policies">
College Board's AP Credit Policy Search tool</a> on May 1, 2024:

   * 57.4% (737 of 1284) colleges accept a 3 or higher for AP CSP
   * 68.1% (1264 of 1855) colleges accept a 3 or higher for AP CSA

   * 1.9% (25 of 1284) colleges accept a minimum of 4 for AP CSP
   * 1.3% (25 of 1855) colleges accept a minimum of 4 for AP CSA

   * 0.9% (11 of 1284) colleges accept only the highest score of 5 for AP CSP
   * 1.2% (23 of 1855) colleges accept only the highest score of 5 for AP CSA
   <br /><br />

When applying for the more stringent colleges, applicants who don't score high enough do not report the score in their application.

The exam will be 3 hours long and will test students on the full course content, including topics like primitive types, using objects, boolean expressions, and iteration.1

   WR 1. Program Design, Function, and Purpose<br />
   WR 2(a). Algorithm Development<br />
   WR 2(b). Errors and Testing<br />
   WR 2(c). Data and Procedural Abstraction<br />
   <br /><br />

### WR 1. Program Design, Function, and Purpose

Identify an expected user of the program and describes one way the program’s design meets the needs of that identified user.

This question is asking you to Identify a specific user of your app AND describing one way the program’s design meets their specific needs. DO NOT describe what the program does.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
The user of my game would be children who are trying to learn their colors in another language. The program design is great for children because each color button is filled with the corresponding color for the word. This will make it easy for students who don't know how to read to still use the app to hear the colors in languages.

### WR 2(a). Algorithm Development

Identify the number of times the loop will execute.  This can be constant or generalization of times AND Describe a condition that would cause an infinite loop in your code, if your code cannot, you have to explain how you would modify your code to become an infinite loop.

This question is asking you to determine the number of times the body of the iteration statement will execute.You must also identify a condition that could impede the termination of the iteration statement, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
The loop iterates until time = 0;  The variable time is being updated in another part of the program.  An infinite loop would occur if in this loop time was increased by enough to offset the decrease that is happening in another part of the program or reset to a large enough value to offset the decrease that is happening.  See example #1


### WR 2(b). Errors and Testing

Describe a change to the procedure that will result in a run-time error AND explains why the change will result in a run- time error.

This question is asking you to describe a way to cause a runtime error in your code.  If you cannot cause one, you need to describe a way your code can be modified to cause a runtime error.  Runtime errors occur during program execution due to unexpected conditions, while compiler errors occur during the compilation phase due to syntax or reference issues in the code.  

AP Example GOOD Answer:
A runtime error would occur if instead of printing i, we printed i / (stop - i).  Once i is equal to stop, a divide by 0 run-time error will occur.  See example #3

### WR 2(c). Data and Procedural Abstraction

To count the number of times a certain value appears in your list using the isEqual(value1, value2) procedure
Steps written in pseudocode, not actual code. Must return a count.

This question is asking for a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, detailing how to traverse through the list, compare each element with the target value using the isEqual procedure, and increment a count variable for each occurrence of the target value. The explanation should be thorough enough that someone else could understand it well enough to write the code based on your instructions. This includes describing the initialization of variables, the iteration process, the use of the isEqual procedure, the counting mechanism, and returning a count.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
Set a counter variable count to 0.  Iterate over the elements of the list named myList.  For each element, call isEqual to compare the element from myList to the given value.  If isEquals returns true add 1 to count.  After iterating over every list value, print the value of count.

## Additional topics

Do the standard curriculum materials enable students to get a job?

As the name of the organization implies, the College Board has an academic rather than vocational focus.

However, several AP instructors (and this instructor does) enrich the materials with real-world tools entry-level contributors need to master.
All these are free unless noted otherwise:

1. Safe computing with email, Passkeys, and personal data protections
2. Secure networking with wifi, internet, cellular, radios

3. AKeyless cloud service to store and dispense SSH and other secrets
4. LinkedIn profile to display achievements and recommendations
5. Trello Kanban boards cloud service to plan and track work collaboration

6. Text editing using Vim and VSCode
7. Git utilities with GitHub cloud service to store and share code
8. GitHub Markdown for creating a static website within GitHub ($75/year)
9. bash/Linux Command line utilities to manage files and folders

10. Low-code e-commerce shops (Gumroad, Shopify, etc.) (freemium)
11. Recording, generation, editing of images, sound, video (freemium)

12. Python Jupyter coding to run Machine Learning in cloud environments (freemium)
13. Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud service to access workstations and data (freemium)

14. Workflow automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins/Cloudbees cloud)
15. OnShape 3D CAD printing and design (freemium)
16. Internet of Things (IoT) to quantify and control physical objects (with AI)
<br /><br />

Developing basic level skill with the above would enable students to subsequently focus on 
mastery with crafting HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Cybersecurity, data engineering, algorithms, automated testing, design, risk management.

There is a professional certification for many of the above skill areas
which provide students to be more competitive when applying for jobs.

Skill with PowerPoint to create presentations would be useful as a prerequisite coming into the AP class.

## Leadership development

The class is structured so that one student can be the "product manager"
responsible for each specific technology listed above.

This provides an opportunity for students to develop leadership and teaching skills. 

There are many "Product Manager" jobs for those who have not mastered all the technologies,
but just one or a few:
   
   * customize descriptions of the technology so it can be easily understood by different audiences
   * promote the use of a technology using various media
   * define and organize events

   * develop training materials
   * present trainings
   * onboard individuals and help troubleshoot usage
   * define a future roadmap
   <br /><br />

This builds a community for the program to become self-sustaining,
to proactively take advantage of changes in technologies as they emerge.
