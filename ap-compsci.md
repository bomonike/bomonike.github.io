This article presents a path for preparing high school students to begin careers in the cyber-enhanced workplace of the 21st century.

Highlights:

1. Before touching a computer, learners earn a "drivers license" about safe computing (A)

2. Earn college credit while in high school by passing AP Computer Science Principles in April

3. Prepare learners to take entry-level professional certifications. Exam questions are reviewed in each module.

   Professional certifications enable faster/cheaper completion of bachelor's degrees such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html">Western Governors Universiity online</a>, where students of this class take CompTIA Security+, Cloud+, Project+, PenTest+ not in the scope of this introductory class.

4. Create quiz questions and learn to take tests confidently.

5. Practice Collaboration using tools professional use.

Gen Z slang "glow-up" = a major improvement in one's self, usually an improvement in appearance, confidence, and style.

## How we learn

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go8qow9I6cM&list=PLwXXOxvDboebhtPwm0cipRwN6tUL-WDc0">Google Classroom</a> is used with 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AaumF0jSAE&list=PLwXXOxvDboebt_ljDSC1GsP1KVaJB0HRH">
Google Meet</a> (instead of Zoom or Microsoft Teams).
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qvm2-I9H40">VIDEO</a>

Use an "inverted classroom" approach, where learners view videos and identify questions about a topic before live class activities about the same topic.

To foster leadership, collaboration, and debugging skills, learners are expected to help each other.

Project Based Learning (PBL) means an authentic, “real-world” Performance Tasks (PTs) to solve a problem related to each topic.

To develop a sequence, we print a card for each step (not labeled for sequence), then debate about why one step should go before another step.

We collaborate by diving tasks among learners.

We seek to learn more from deduction than being told.

We use <strong>active learning</strong> - practical hands-on projects

We reference <strong>checklists</strong> from others who have mastered the topic.

For help with memorization recall such as glossary definitions, we use paper flash cards and Quizlet.com:
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBPpyAuWi14">use Google Sheets</a>.

## Early Alternatives

To gain a higher chance for admission into top universities,<br />
to have more freedom to take classes,<br />
to take more advanced classes sooner, <br />
to graduate sooner,<br />
to build a more impressive resume for jobs,<br />
students, while still in high school, can earn college credits:

1. Take classes on-line at community colleges which accept high school students.

2. Attend a nearby community college on-site within "duel enrollment" programs so credits earned apply to both high school and university graduation requirements.

3. Score high enough on credit-by-examination:
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-exams">College Board's CLEP (College-Level Examination Program®)</a> have $93 year-round exams for anyone (with parent approval at age 13 or below).

The College Board conducts <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses">exams in 38 academic subjects</a>. Each year, some exams are retired and others are added.

Within the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) category, for 2023/24 the College Board offered <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/compare-ap-computer-science-courses">two</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.collegeboard.org/difference-between-ap-computer-science-principles-and-ap-computer-science
">different</a> Computer Science AP exams:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles">"<strong>AP CSP</strong>" for the <strong>AP Computer Science Principles</strong></a> exam on the "Big ideas of computer science (including algorithms and programming)" (computational thinking and fluency).

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a">"<strong>AP CSA</strong>" for the <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong></a> exam on "Problem solving and object-oriented programming" in the Java programming language.

The College Board's exam names have a suffix "A" to designate the equivalent of a first-semester college course in a subject area. A two-semester series has a suffix of "AB" or "BC".

There was a time when there was a "AP Computer Science AB" which covered all the topics of AP Computer Science A plus more formal and in-depth study of algorithms, data structures, and data abstractions. That exam was discontinued after the 2008–2009 year.

The two exams can be taken in any order.
There are no limit on retakes.

## Computer Science A (CSA)

AP Computer Science was taught using Pascal for the 1984–1998 exams, C++ for 1999–2003, and object-oriented <strong>Java</strong> since 2004 as AP Computer Science A.

https://help.codehs.com/en/articles/1121548-using-the-codehs-sandbox

<strong>Units</strong> listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-overview.pdf">pdf about the 3-hour CSA exam</a>:

   1. Primitive (Data) Types
   2. Using Objects (Methods and Control Structures)
   3. Boolean Expressions and if Statements
   4. Iteration
   5. Classes
   6. Array
   7. ArrayList
   8. 2D Array
   9. Inheritance
   10. Recursion (Computational Thinking)
   <br /><br />

PROTIP: Almost all the above concepts need to be addressed with all programming languages, but with different implementations.

One concern about CSA is that the programming lack the <strong>context</strong> of building a complete system, which programmers need to do.

## CSP Concepts

There exists other programming languages (Assembly, C, C#, F#, Go, JavaScript, Lua, PHP, Rust, Swift, TypeScript, Zig, etc.).

Recently, many teachers of the AP CSP exam select the <strong>Python</strong> programming langauge, which is popular among Data Scientists working with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning that's all the rage since 2023.

## Why Computer Science?

Studing of Computer Science is not mutually exclusive with studying other subjects.

Because virtually all professional now use computers, even within trades, 
skill with using computer hardware and software efficiently and securely enhances success in other disciplines.

These computational thinking practices are skills students should develop during the CSP course:

   * Computational Solution Design: Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
   * Algorithms: procedures to solve problems and obtain answers
   * Abstraction in Program Development: Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
   * Code Analysis: Evaluate and test programs.
   * Computing Innovations: Investigate 
   * Responsible Computing: Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.
   <br /><br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flvs.net/high-school-courses/course/ap-computer-science-a/12/">One school</a> specified that for CSA, "Algebra 1 required. Algebra 2 and prior programming experience (i.e. Foundations of Programming) recommended." 

Students may have prior experience with Computer Science topics:

   * Turtle graphics and micro:bit in <a target="_blank" href="https://codehs.com/course/9434/explore">"Tech Apps and Coding" at CodeHS</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://codehs.com/uploads/379980882e1302b1493894153a851a2e">180 contact hours</a>) to meet Montana <a target="_blank" href="https://csteachers.org/k12standards/interactive/">CSTA 2 (Computer Science Teachers Association) standards</a> for students in grades 6-8

   <br /><br />

But the CSP exam doesn't require much math and has one of the highest passing rates (68%) and is known to be one of the easiest exams. So it's feasible to take CSP as a Sophomore.

This is why, within the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings">highest-ranked high schools in the US</a>, it's not uncommon for ambitious Sophomores and even Freshmen (9th or 10th grade) to take a Computer Science course so they have more time to take AP exams in other topics in their Junior and Senior year-end. That enables students to fully participate in extracurricula activities for a well-rounded experience. 

> “Colleges are looking at the context of what’s available to that student and how they have challenged themselves accordingly,” --<a target="_blank" href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-to-determine-the-right-number-of-ap-classes-to-take">this article</a>


## Fees & Dates

The exam is proctored just once at the end of each academic year, in May or early June, depending on the school test site. Late tests take place during the third week of May.

   * CSP Create performance task submission deadline is Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. local time.
   * CSP testing is Wednesday, May 15, 2024 at 12:00 PM in the afternoon local time.
   * CSA testing is Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 12:00 PM in the afternoon local time, taken as a full-length paper-and-pencil exam that students can only take in school, not virtually.
   <br /><br />

Starting in <strong>February</strong>, students register for AP Exams through the school they attend. Each school's AP coordinator collect from students in the US <a target="_blank" href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/exam-fees"><strong>$98</strong></a> USD per exam when they sign up.
The College Board provides fee reductions (to $53) for eligible students with financial need. AP Seminar or AP Research exams are $146.

Schools have until November 15 to let College Board know which students are testing.

AP scores come out about two months after the exam, during the beginning of July. 

The College Board's phone is 212-632-1780 or 888-225-5427 (toll free in the United States and Canada).

As the name of the organization implies, the College Board has an academic rather than vocational focus.

However, the aim of this course is to enable students to be more job ready.

## Scores

One does not need to take a class before taking the exam. 
But almost all students do.

Results are reported on a scale from 1 to 5. Most colleges recognize a score of 3 as the basis for a student in lieu of taking the Fundamentals class. This enables the student to take more advanced classes earlier in college. AP exams can boost a student's chances of being accepted at competitive colleges.

Historically, 12% of test takers received a mark of 5 on the CSP.

The mean score for all 2023 AP Exams was 2.96. More than 60% of all exams taken earned a score of 3 or higher. 
https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores/score-distributions
AP Score Distributions.
AP Computer Science Principles, 63.1% received a score of 3 or higher.

Using <a target="_blank" href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/getting-credit-placement/search-policies">
College Board's AP Credit Policy Search tool</a> on May 1, 2024:

   * 57.4% (737 of 1284) colleges accept a 3 or higher for AP CSP
   * 68.1% (1264 of 1855) colleges accept a 3 or higher for AP CSA

   * 1.9% (25 of 1284) colleges accept a minimum of 4 for AP CSP
   * 1.3% (25 of 1855) colleges accept a minimum of 4 for AP CSA

   * 0.9% (11 of 1284) colleges accept only the highest score of 5 for AP CSP
   * 1.2% (23 of 1855) colleges accept only the highest score of 5 for AP CSA
   <br /><br />

When applying for the more stringent colleges, applicants who don't score high enough do not report the score in their application.

The exam will be 3 hours long and will test students on the full course content, including topics like primitive types, using objects, boolean expressions, and iteration.1

   WR 1. Program Design, Function, and Purpose<br />
   WR 2(a). Algorithm Development<br />
   WR 2(b). Errors and Testing<br />
   WR 2(c). Data and Procedural Abstraction<br />
   <br /><br />

### WR 1. Program Design, Function, and Purpose

Identify an expected user of the program and describes one way the program’s design meets the needs of that identified user.

This question is asking you to Identify a specific user of your app AND describing one way the program’s design meets their specific needs. DO NOT describe what the program does.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
The user of my game would be children who are trying to learn their colors in another language. The program design is great for children because each color button is filled with the corresponding color for the word. This will make it easy for students who don't know how to read to still use the app to hear the colors in languages.

### WR 2(a). Algorithm Development

Identify the number of times the loop will execute.  This can be constant or generalization of times AND Describe a condition that would cause an infinite loop in your code, if your code cannot, you have to explain how you would modify your code to become an infinite loop.

This question is asking you to determine the number of times the body of the iteration statement will execute.You must also identify a condition that could impede the termination of the iteration statement, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
The loop iterates until time = 0;  The variable time is being updated in another part of the program.  An infinite loop would occur if in this loop time was increased by enough to offset the decrease that is happening in another part of the program or reset to a large enough value to offset the decrease that is happening.  See example #1


### WR 2(b). Errors and Testing

Describe a change to the procedure that will result in a run-time error AND explains why the change will result in a run- time error.

This question is asking you to describe a way to cause a runtime error in your code.  If you cannot cause one, you need to describe a way your code can be modified to cause a runtime error.  Runtime errors occur during program execution due to unexpected conditions, while compiler errors occur during the compilation phase due to syntax or reference issues in the code.  

AP Example GOOD Answer:
A runtime error would occur if instead of printing i, we printed i / (stop - i).  Once i is equal to stop, a divide by 0 run-time error will occur.  See example #3

### WR 2(c). Data and Procedural Abstraction

To count the number of times a certain value appears in your list using the isEqual(value1, value2) procedure
Steps written in pseudocode, not actual code. Must return a count.

This question is asking for a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, detailing how to traverse through the list, compare each element with the target value using the isEqual procedure, and increment a count variable for each occurrence of the target value. The explanation should be thorough enough that someone else could understand it well enough to write the code based on your instructions. This includes describing the initialization of variables, the iteration process, the use of the isEqual procedure, the counting mechanism, and returning a count.

AP Example GOOD Answer:
Set a counter variable count to 0.  Iterate over the elements of the list named myList.  For each element, call isEqual to compare the element from myList to the given value.  If isEquals returns true add 1 to count.  After iterating over every list value, print the value of count.

Several AP instructors (and this instructor does) enrich the materials with real-world tools entry-level contributors need to master. All these are free unless noted otherwise:

<br /><br />

The average number of school days in a school year in the United States is <strong>180 days</strong> (within a range from 170 to 185 days).
So there are roughly 36 weeks in a school year (180 days ÷ 5 days per week).

## Professional certifications

Some entry-level professional certifications can be earned (for a fee) as early as high school,
which provide students to be more competitive when applying for jobs.

Skill with PowerPoint to create presentations would be useful as a prerequisite coming into the AP class.

## Leadership development

The class is structured so that one student can be the "product manager"
responsible for each specific technology listed above.

This provides an opportunity for students to develop leadership and teaching skills. 

There are many "Product Manager" jobs for those who have not mastered all the technologies,
but just one or a few:
   
   * customize descriptions of the technology so it can be easily understood by different audiences
   * promote the use of a technology using various media
   * define and organize events

   * develop training materials
   * present trainings
   * onboard individuals and help troubleshoot usage
   * define a future roadmap
   <br /><br />

This builds a community for the program to become self-sustaining,
to proactively take advantage of changes in technologies as they emerge.

   Heavy use of cellphones by adolescents has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes, from increasing risk of anxiety to suicidal ideation. Nearly half of children ages 10 to 17 who use social media wind up on porn sites, according to Rich. And in a recent survey of an estimated 1,300 girls ages 11 to 15 by nonprofit Common Sense Media, most respondents who reported using Snapchat or Instagram said they’d been contacted by a stranger via these social media platforms in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.
