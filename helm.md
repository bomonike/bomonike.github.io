This article is a hands-on introduction about Helm "Charts" used to stand up a Kubernetes cluster.

{% include whatever.html %}

Helm simplifies discovering and deploying services to a Kubernetes cluster.
Helm reduces "configuration sprawl" of different specifications for Dev, Staging, UAT, QA, Prod.

Thus, Helm competes with docker-compose. 

Here is the guided tour (aimed to be succinct yet deep):

1. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh/">helm.sh</a>, Helm's marketing home page (served from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/helm/helm-www">https://github.com/helm/helm-www</a> using hugo). It calls helm a package manager for Kubernets (like Brew on macOS, Chocolately on Windows, apt on Debian/Ubuntu, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(software)">yum</a> on Red Hat, etc).
   Helm is a cloud industry consortium composed of Google, Microsoft, Bitnami, and others.

   ### Why Helm?

   Helm has become popular with cloud developers largely because it simplifies Kubernetes application management,
   the roll out of updates, and options to share applications.
   Package management features make it easier to:

   - search available packages -
   - provide information on packages
   - download and install packages, along with dependencies, creation of folders, and insertion of those folders in the system's PATH variable
   - list installed packages
   - lint installed packages
   - update existing installed packages
   - delete packages
     <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Words in Chart names are separated by dashes, not underlines nor dots.

1. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/helm/helm">https://github.com/helm/helm</a> where Helm is open-sourced.

   Helm was created by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbutcher/">Matt Butcher ("The Mister Rogers of Cloud Native" living in Boulder, Colorado, USA)</a> and others at <a target="_blank" href="https://deislabs.io/">Deislabs.io</a> (acquired by Microsoft in May 2017). 
   
   In 2016, Helm was donated Helm to CNCF (the same organization who owns Kubernetes itself).

1. Visit the latest release at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/helm/helm/releases">https://github.com/helm/helm/releases</a>

   CNCF graduated Helm2 in 2016. Helm3 released in 2019.

   <tt>helm version</tt> on your laptop is a different version sequence.

   ## Architecture

   The <a href="#Client">Helm CLI client</a> running on your local machine sends requests to Kubernetes.
   
   This CLI client is needed because operations such as rollback, running chart tests, etc. are done from the Helm CLI client.

   ## No more Tiller in Helm 3
   
   According to https://helm.sh/docs/community/history/

   Until Helm3 was released November 2019 with <strong>Kubernetes 1.16</strong>, a <strong>Tiller server</strong> (and <tt>helm init</tt> that starts it) ran inside the Kubernetes cluster to manage (install, upgrade, query, and remove) Kubernetes resources via calls to the Kubernetes API server. <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#removal-of-tiller">[1]</a> 
   Helm3 removed Tiller and shifts to Helm itself the security, identity, and authorization features.

   See https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3 for the <em>strangler</em> pattern (co-existing in the same cluster) or <em>in situ</em> (with migration).

   <pre><strong>helm3 plugin list</strong></pre>

   Helm 3 uses <strong>Secrets</strong> as the default storage driver
   instead of Helm 2's <strong>ConfigMaps</strong> (default) to store release information. 

   The chart dependency management system has moved from requirements.yaml and requirements.lock in Helm 2 to Chart.yaml and Chart.lock in Helm3. An improved upgrade strategy, leveraging three-way strategic merge patches. Helm considers the old manifest, its live state, and the new manifest of when generating a patch.

## Helm CLI client

   On your Terminal on any folder:

   This extends and summarizes <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/">https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install</a>

1. Install Kubernetes first.

   PROTIP: The Helm client learns about Kubernetes clusters by using files in the Kube config file. By default, Helm attempts to find this file in the place where kubectl creates it (\$HOME/.kube/config).

1. See whether you already have it installed:

   <a name="HelmVersion"></a>

   ### Helm CLI Version

   <pre><strong>helm version</strong></pre>

   If you see something like this, you already have it installed:

   <pre>version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.10.1", GitCommit:"9f88ccb6aee40b9a0535fcc7efea6055e1ef72c9", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.19.2"}
   </pre>

1. What is the latest Kubernetes helm CLI client for macOS?

   <pre><strong>brew info helm</strong></pre>

   Response at time of writing:

      <pre>helm: stable 3.2.1 (bottled), HEAD
The Kubernetes package manager

/usr/local/Cellar/helm/3.1.0 (7 files, 41.2MB) *
   </pre>

1. To install helm CLI client for the first time:

   <pre><strong>brew install helm</strong></pre>

   To upgrade Kubernetes helm CLI client (if brew info returned a version):

   <pre><strong>brew upgrade helm</strong></pre>

   Sample response:

   <pre>==> Downloading https://storage.googleapis.com/helm/releases/v3.1.0/helm-darwin-amd64
   </pre>

   Obtain the version again after an upgrade.

   PROTIP: Helm is written in the Go language, built using the Make utility.

   ### helm env

1. Examine your local Helm enviorinment locations:

   <pre><strong>helm env</strong></pre>

   Notice that the MacOS Library is used as storage locations:

   <pre>HELM_BIN="helm"
HELM_BURST_LIMIT="100"
HELM_CACHE_HOME="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/Caches/helm"
HELM_CONFIG_HOME="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/Preferences/helm"
HELM_DATA_HOME="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/helm"
HELM_DEBUG="false"
HELM_KUBEAPISERVER=""
HELM_KUBEASGROUPS=""
HELM_KUBEASUSER=""
HELM_KUBECAFILE=""
HELM_KUBECONTEXT=""
HELM_KUBEINSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY="false"
HELM_KUBETLS_SERVER_NAME=""
HELM_KUBETOKEN=""
HELM_MAX_HISTORY="10"
HELM_NAMESPACE="default"
HELM_PLUGINS="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/helm/plugins"
HELM_REGISTRY_CONFIG="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/Preferences/helm/registry/config.json"
HELM_REPOSITORY_CACHE="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/Caches/helm/repository"
HELM_REPOSITORY_CONFIG="/Users/wilsonmar/Library/Preferences/helm/repositories.yaml"
   </pre>

   NOTE: Helm stores its configuration files in XDG Base directory specifications created the first time helm is run.

   <pre>Cache:  $XDG_CACHE_HOME - ${HOME}/<strong>.cache</strong>/helm/
Config: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME - ${HOME}/<strong>.config</strong>/helm/
Data:   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME - ${HOME}/<strong>.local</strong>/helm/
   </pre>

   Helm 3 puts K8s CRD's (Custom Resource Definitions) in the "crds" directory and can be skipped using <tt>\-\-skip-crds</tt> on install. https://github.com/bitnami-labs/helm-crd is not under active development.

   Helm 3 has a GoSDK CLI.

   Open Container Initiative (OCI) with Docker Registry API.

## Create new Helm Chart

A Helm "Chart" is a collective noun for a set of folders and files.

1. Create a new Helm Chart:

   <pre><strong>helm create mychart
   </strong></pre>

   Optionally, <tt>--starter</tt> option can be added to specify a “starter chart”.

   Starter Charts are copied to <tt>\$XDG_DATA_HOME/helm/starters</tt>. Chart developers author charts specifically designed to be used as starters. The Chart.yaml of starters are overwritten by the generator.
   Users will expect to modify such a chart’s contents, so documentation should indicate how users can do so.
   Starter charts can be used as templates, with all occurrences of CHARTNAME replaced with the specified chart name.

1. Examine the files created using a Tree command:

      <pre><strong>tree</strong></pre>

      <pre>├── Chart.yaml
   ├── charts
   ├── templates
   └── values.yaml
      </pre>

   REMEMBER: Each Helm Chart must contain a <tt>Chart.yaml</tt> file (with a capital C), a <tt>values.yaml</tt> file (with a lower case v) to override default values with your own information.

   Those files provide files to "handlebars" within yaml files in the <tt>templates</tt> directory/folder containing Kubernetes deployment.yaml and other files, 
   
   Sometimes other charts are in a chart folder.

1. In an editor (such as VSCode), open the <tt>Chart.yaml</tt> file. 

   PROTIP: <tt>apiVersion</tt> is v2 starting with Helm3. Confusing, I know.
   
   ### Yaml

   REMEMBER: In <a target="_blank" href="https://yaml.org/spec/">yaml format</a> files, indents use two spaces (and never tabs). (Kubernetes objects) into one unit. The <tt>charts</tt> file defines dependencies.

   ## Templates folder

1. In the templates folder:

   <pre>
   ├── templates
   │   ├── NOTES.txt
   │   ├── _helpers.tpl
   │   ├── deployment.yaml
   │   ├── ingress.yaml
   │   ├── service.yaml
   │   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
   │   └── tests
   │       └── test-connection.yaml
   </pre>

   Template yaml files contain placeholders:

      <pre>\{\{- if .Values.serviceAccount.create -}}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: \{\{ include "my-chart.serviceAccountName" . }}
     labels:
       \{\{- include "my-chart.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
     \{\{- with .Values.serviceAccount.annotations }}
     annotations:
       \{\{- toYaml . | nindent 4 }}
     \{\{- end }}
   \{\{- end -}}
   </pre>

   From: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8SHvNZGeE">VIDEO: What is Helm? (with Tiller) Dec 18, 2019</a> [9:05]:
   <a target="\_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/74785670-d1584e80-5278-11ea-9eb5-722c0fc4fa10.jpg"><img alt="helm-ibm-1151x649.jpg" width="1151" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/74785670-d1584e80-5278-11ea-9eb5-722c0fc4fa10.jpg"></a>

   ### Dependencies in requirements.yaml

   The <tt>requirements.yaml</tt> file to Kubernetes specifies a MariaDB database:

   <pre>dependencies:
   - name: mariadb
     version: 0.6.0
     repository: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
   </pre>

   The <tt>chart folder</tt> is populated by the archive of "dependencies" of other charts with its own set of yaml files.


<a name="Linting"></a>

### Lint a Chart

1. Validate that a Chart follows the conventions and requirements of the Helm chart standard <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files">JSON schema</a>

   Linting is automatic with helm install, upgrade, and template.
   But you can run it anytime:

      <pre><strong>helm lint</strong></pre>

   Sample output:

      <pre>==> Linting .
   [INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended
   &nbsp;
   1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed
      </pre>

   See https://www.waytoeasylearn.com/learn/helm-lint/


### Specify app

Since Kubernetes works off Docker images, specify the Docker image, such as the simple "ToDo" app:

   <pre><strong>image:
   repository: prydonius/todo
   tag: latest
   pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   </strong></pre>

The client CLI knows to look for the repository within the <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh">https://hub.helm.sh</a> public repository.

PROTIP: A <tt>Chart release</tt> number is an incremental counter that advances forward even on rollback.
A <a target="_blank" href="https://semver.org/">Sematic version number</a> (such as 1.2.3) is required on every chart.

2. Search for the <strong>ToDo</strong> chart this tutorial uses.

3. For a list of all apps in Hub:

   <pre><strong>help search hub</strong></pre>

1. A repository of helm charts to "find, install, and publish Kubernetes packages":

   <a target="_blank" href="https://artifacthub.io/">artifacthub.io</a>


### Search apps

2. Search for a specific Chart:

   <pre><strong>helm search hub vault</strong></pre>

   Note that the list contains "stable" and "incubator" editions.

3. To see logos among publicly available charts, view <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/">https://hub.helm.sh</a>, search for "stable" Charts:

   - <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/anchore-engine">Anchore</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/banzaicloud-stable/clair">Clair</a>
   - web server <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/apache">Apache</a>, Nginx, Tomcat, WordPress
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/argo/argo-cd">Argo-cd</a>, GitLab
   - Artifactory
   - Databases: Cassandra, Mongodb, <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/cockroachdb">CockroadhDB</a>, MySQL, Neo4j, Spark, Spinniker
   - Secrets manager: Consul, Vault
   - Testing tools: JMeter, Selenium
   - Elastic Stack, Logstash, Prometheus, Kibana,
   - Weave
   <br /><br />

   ### Add repo

1. Define that folder in a system environment variable for use in shell file statements below:

   <pre><strong>MY_HELM_PATH="~/github-wilsonmar/helm-samples" 
   </strong></pre>

   Replace "github-wilsonmar" with your folder.

1. Create then Navigate to a folder holding your Helm chart.

   <pre><strong>cd 
   echo "${MY_HELM_PATH}"
   mkdir "${MY_HELM_PATH}"
   cd "${MY_HELM_PATH}"
   </strong></pre>

1. Add:

   <pre><strong>helm repo add dev https://hub.helm.sh
   </strong></pre>

   FIXME: ??? If you get back:

   <pre>Error: looks like "https://hub.helm.sh" is not a valid chart repository or cannot be reached: error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type repo.IndexFile
   </pre>

   

### Install Chart in Kubernetes

This is a summary of https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/

1. Run it:

   <pre><strong>helm install --name todo "${MY_HELM_PATH}"
   --dry-run --debug  --set service.type=NodePort
   </strong></pre>

1. Highlight and copy the response to your Clipboard to paste in your local Terminal:

   For example:

      <pre>export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get —-namespace default -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services todo-mychart)
   export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes —-namespace default -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
   echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT 
      </pre>

1. Copy and paste the URL in the response (such as http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser's address to see the app's UI.

   ### Komodor install

   Alternately, Komodor.io provides this to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/k8s-watcher#komodorio">install</a>:

   <pre>helm repo add komodorio https://helm-charts.komodor.io ; helm repo update; helm upgrade --install k8s-watcher komodorio/k8s-watcher --set watcher.actions.basic=true --set watcher.actions.advanced=true --set apiKey=12345678-abcd-3333-ccc-2edb0fe9e263 --set watcher.clusterName=default  --wait --timeout=90s && open https://app.komodor.com/main/services
   </pre>


   ### In Kubernetes

1. See what is running in the Kubernetes cluster:

   <pre><strong>helm list --all
   </strong></pre>

   ### Uninstall

1. To uninstall

   <pre><strong>helm uninstall --keep-history</strong></pre>


   ### Package to Archive

1. Package a Chart folder:

   <pre><strong>helm package mychart</strong></pre>

   After a Chart is packaged by being tarred and gzipped (compressed/packed) to a .tgz file, and optionally signed, it is called an <tt>archive</tt>.

   <pre><strong>helm verify my-chart-0.1.0.tgz
   </strong></pre>

   A Chart may be accompanied by a <tt>.prov (provenance) file</tt> which details where the chart came from and what it contains. The cryptographic hash (signature OpenPGP “clearsign” block)) of the chart archive file is used to determine whether the chart file has been tampered with.

1) Package a Chart folder:

### Helmsman Desired State Configurator

Open-sourced at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman/">https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman</a>, <a target="_blank" title="dated MARCH 1, 2018" href="https://www.praqma.com/stories/introducing-helmsman/">Helmsman from Praqma</a> (by SAMI ALAJRAMI and others)
provides an "autopilot" for Kubernetes clusters which automates the lifecycle management of Helm Charts using declarative (desired state) configuration files (DSF) to create, delete, upgrade, and move Kubernetes objects to different namespaces.
This approach makes it easier to replicate a CI pipeline.
This also takes care of secrets passing (from environment variables to Charts).

https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/helmsman/

The desired state approach achieves idempotentcy - executing Helmsman several times gets the same result, and continues from failures.

Helm 3: Navigating to Distant Shores</a>
by Codefresh

If you have an O'Reilly subscription, the 10 minute "almost-live" hands-on scenario (from Katota) <a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/get-started-with/9781492062035/">"Get Started with the Helm Package Manager"</a> has you clicking each command and see it executed on an Ubuntu Bash terminal. This scenario teaches you how to use Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, to deploy Redis. 

1. Wait for Kubernetes to start. Then install it using a curl command.
2. The scenario is based on version 2 because it tells you to update the local cache to sync the latest available packages with the environment:

   <pre><strong>helm init
   helm repo update</strong></pre>

3. helm search redis
4. helm inspect stable/redis to see configuration policies.
5. To deploy the chart to your cluster:

   helm install stable/redis

6. List package namespaces installed:

   helm ls

7. Find out what pods, replication controllers, and services (master and slave) were deployed:

   kubectl get all

8. List the persistent volumes available:

   kubectl apply -f pv.yaml

   The pod remains in a pending state while the Docker Image is downloaded.

9. Grant Redis data mount permissions to write:

   chmod 777 -R /mnt/data*

9. Provide helm with a more friendly name "my-release":

   helm install --name my-release stable/redis

9. To get your password run:

    export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default dinky-newt-redis-o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)

9. To connect to your Redis server, run a Redis pod that you can use as a client:

   kubectl run --namespace default dinky-newt-redis-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' \
    --env REDIS_PASSWORD=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
   --image docker.io/bitnami/redis:5.0.7-debian-10-r27 -- bash

1. Connect using the Redis CLI:
 
   redis-cli -h dinky-newt-redis-master -a $REDIS_PASSWORD
   redis-cli -h dinky-newt-redis-slave -a $REDIS_PASSWORD

1. To connect to your database from outside the cluster execute the following commands:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/dinky-newt-redis-master 6379:6379 &
    redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a $REDIS_PASSWORD
