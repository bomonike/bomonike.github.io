would be project. Management skills. Offer training in tools such as calendar, project planning, estimating, prioritization

ALL our sample projects demonstrate <strong>practical, real world</strong> tools for <strong>productive use</strong>.
xx While other offering have students create games of no practical values,

We equip students for making money in a future of AI domination, <strong>managing</strong> AI automation:
   * Building systems to evaluate AI performance
   * Introducing AI automation into local businesses
   * The orchestrator can route traffic to several tools, but chooses the tool with the best satisfaction and accuracy scores tracked over time.

The multi-agent AI system we show agents how to build:
   * is run locally on a Mac Mini or similar class machine
   * uses open-source
   * interacts with mobile apps that run on Android and iPhones.

Content (learning) is presented in short (up to 8 second) videos as a multiple choice quiz.
Selection of each option would lead to text or video. 
Videos are generated from text using Google Gemini Veo3.
Comments can be added by others.

AI project: Drop pdf files on the GUI, then ask questions based on its content.

“Commits.to has given me reason to pause before I rattle off an empty promise.
As a people pleaser, I was in the habit of
saying I would do things without a real
intention to follow through on those
statements in a consistent way. Now, I
value maintaining my overall reliability
instead of my agreeability in the moment.”
