Over the years, I've been updating this page as a reference when watching documentaries, traveling to museums. Many dates are approximate and controversial. I welcome your comments.

## A Panorama of History?

What are the most significant events in world history, and what do they tell us about the future?

   * BC = B.C.=B.C.E. (Before Christ = Before the Common Era)
   * AD = A.D.=C.E. (Anno Domini = Common Era)
   <br /><br />

It turns out I found one ancient book that has been proven to be a reliable chronicle: the "Judeon-Christian" Bible (66 Old and 44 New Testament books) which were written in several languages in the ancient Hebrew Masoretic Text, the <em lang="gr">Textus Receptus</em> in <em lang="gr">koine</em> (common) Greek, Aramaic. Over the years, various translations have been created for different audiences over the world. This article is written for reading online by readers of English. Underlined links to passages referenced in the Bible are presented by the <a target="_blank" href="https://BlueLetterBible.org/">BlueLetterBible.org</a>. Readers can select from among several translations in English:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1694505960/history-bibles-2711x398_a8jjgt.png"><img alt="history-bibles.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1694505960/history-bibles-2711x398_a8jjgt.png" width="100%" /></a>

The default here is the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible from 1611 Anglican England. The KJV is in the public domain and is considered by many to be the most accurate translation of the original Hebrew Masoretic Text and Greek <em lang="gr">Textus Receptus</em>. The BlueLetterBible.org site also provides a concordance of where each (of 6,000) words is referenced. There are also commentaries to help readers better understand the original meaning of the words and concepts in the Bible.


### Timeline of History?

<a href="#Other+Timelines">Several</a> have deduced timelines presenting the most significant events. Below is one version <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJlIcmiz0fs">from CJ Lovik</a> in 2023:

## Contextual Principles

To understand the various events in world history, it helps to have some context:

1.  One day is as a thousand years

    "... one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" &#151;<a target="bible" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/psa/90/4/s_568004">Psalm 90:4 (NKJ)</a> &amp; <a target="bible" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/3/8/s_1159008">2nd Peter 3:8 (NKJ)</a>

1.  Ancient calendars around the world initially used a <a target="_blank" href="https://360dayyear.com/">360-day calendar</a> without leap years and 5 extra days (in 31-day months) to make the cycle of seasons uniformity on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Equinox">equinoxes</a> of 20 March and 23 September -- when daytime and nighttime are of equal duration.

    Although the Roman Julian calendar reform of 45 BC adopted a 365-day solar calendar with modern leap years, when John in 95 AD wrote the Book of Revelation, he used lunar-based 360-day years. Specifically, the verse "holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months" in (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/11/2/s_1178002">11:2</a> is 42 * 30 = 1260 days, the same as "a thousand two hundred and threescore days" (where "threescore" is 60) in the next paragraph <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/11/3/s_1178003">11:3</a>. That's not 1278 days of 3.5 years by a 365-day calendar with some 31-day months.

	BTW Major financial software used today uses a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/360-day_calendar">360-day calendar (to calculate interest)</a>.

1.  Writings about the future necessarily also deal with the cosmic realm not visible to the naked eye nor measurable using scientific instruments. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/6/12/s_1107012">Ephesians 6:12</a>

    "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."

1.  The Bible focuses on one country/people: the 12 tribes of Israel, their 7 feasts each lunar year, and their capital Jerusalem. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/psa/122/6/s_592006">Psalm 122:6</a> says "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee."

    Some analysts look to the "Jubilee" years that repeat every 7-years. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/lev/25/8/s_153008">Leviticus 25:8</a>) 2023 and 2030 are Jubilee years.

1.  The multi-decade <a href="#Sieges">sieges of Jerusalem</a> occurred because God of the Bible did not receive acknowledgment of supremacy from his people (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/45/7/s_740007">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The first of 10 Commandments. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/20/1/s_1001">Exodus 20:1</a>)

1.  To the "elect" of Christians, the New Testament fulfills predictions in the Old Testament -- that of redemption from Adam's sin through Jesus Christ, applicable to all people. Isaiah 11:11-12

    Romans 10:12  For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

1.  The 70th week of Daniel (7 years of Tribulation). See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZkvtjGOh8">Ron Wyatt’s Red Sea Discoveries</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehgdgVblCyE">Talmud</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Talmud">Talmud</a>

1.  A pivotal basis for an important prediction is "when the sacrifice cease". <a target="_blank" href="">This video</a> points out that it refers not in the plural (sacrifices of the Tabernacle system), but singluar -- of Christ's sacrifice.

1.  Many are concerned about the "Mark of the Beast" (666) an how those who take it will be condemned to hell.

    Why would having a shopping mark have a religious connection? My personal conjecture is that it somehow interferes with the spiritual connection with God. God hears our thoughts as prayers. Disrupting prayer disrupts community with God.

	Romans 10:9  ... believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Astronomer Barry Setterfield of Australia theorizes that because the speed of light is decreasing geometrically, millions of years could have gone by in our current perception of time. The Bible speaks of this:

   * Martin Anstey's 1913 &quot;Romance of Bible Chronology&quot;.
   * Edwin R. Thiele, in his The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (Academie Books, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, 1983) further untangled the chronology of the monarchic period.

The stand-off between Biblical and archeological discoveries in Egypt and other countries surrounding Isreal was resolved in 1990 by physicist Gerald E. Aardsma in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/products/book.php">A New Approach to the Chronology of Biblical History from Abraham to Samuel</a>. It concludes that the &quot;480 years&quot; in (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1ki/6/1/s_297001">1 Kings 6:1</a>) contradicts with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/13/19/s_1031019">Acts 13:19-20</a> and archeological records because of an early (rare, <em>homeoarkton</em>) copy error of &quot;1480&quot; years. (Similar to an issue with the translation of Samuel 6:19, where the number of people killed by God for looking into the Ark of the Covenant was mistranslated as 50,070 instead of 70.)

## Early History

<br /> <strong>Jan 1, 4713 BC</strong> (-4712 CE) - First Julian Date (Epoch) on the Gregorian Calendar, as proposed in 1583 by Joseph Justus Scaliger, who named the epoch after his father's name. Complex formulas are needed to convert between the two due to its use of the 19-year Metonic cycle (lunar phase cycle). The Julian calendar added one extra day every four years, but this led to an overcorrection of about 11 minutes per year (one day every 128 years). The Gregorian calendar introduced a more accurate calculation of leap years by omitting three leap years every 400 years. The change created a period of about 350 years (1582-1920s) where two different dating systems were in use simultaneously. Historians used notations like O.S. (Old Style) for Julian dates and N.S.

### Ancient Egypt

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phar/hd_phar.htm">From the Met</a>:
Our knowledge of the succession of Egyptian kings is based on kinglists kept by the ancient Egyptians themselves. The most famous are the Palermo Stone, which covers the period from the earliest dynasties to the middle of Dynasty 5; the Abydos Kinglist, which Seti I had carved on his temple at Abydos; and the Turin Canon, a papyrus that covers the period from the earliest dynasties to the reign of Ramesses II. All are incomplete or fragmentary. We also rely on the History of Egypt written by Manetho in the third century B.C. A priest in the temple at Heliopolis, Manetho had access to many original sources and it was he who divided the kings into the thirty dynasties we use today.

* 3100 BC Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer during the Early Dynastic Period
* 2649–2150 BC Old Kingdom: Dynasty 3-6
* 2150–2030 BC First Intermediate Period: Dynasty 7–11 first half
* 2040–1640 BC Middle Kingdom: Dynasty 11 second half - Dynasty 13
* 1550–1070 BC New Kingdom: Dynasty 18–20 (Ramesses II the Great)
* 1070–713 BC Third Intermediate Period: Dynasty 21–24
* 712–332 BC Late Period: Dynasty 25–30
* 332–304 BC Macedonian Period: Alexander the Great
* 304–30 BC Ptolemaic Period: Dynasty 31–34
* 30 BC–395 AD Roman Period: Ptolemy

The word pharaoh is not from the Egyptian language but is the Hebrew word for the King of Egypt's palace.

<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs">Pharoahs of ancient Egypt</a> are each identified by a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Dynasty_of_Egypt#/media/File:SecondDynastyKingLists.png">cartouche</a>. Each ruled for an average of 25 years. The first king was Menes, who ruled for 62 years. The last king was Cleopatra VII, who ruled for 21 years. The longest-reigning monarch was Pepi II, who ruled for 94 years. Mention of some were erased from history by their successors. The Bible mentions some of them by name, such as Shishak (1 Kings 14:25-26) and Necho (2 Kings 23:29-35). Chronology places the beginning of the Old Kingdom in the 27th century BC (+/- 300 years), the beginning of the Middle Kingdom in the 21st century BC and the beginning of the New Kingdom in the mid-16th century BC.
the "New Chronology" proposed in the 1990s, which lowers New Kingdom dates by as much as 350 years, or the "Glasgow Chronology" (proposed 1978–1982), which lowers New Kingdom dates by as much as 500 years.
