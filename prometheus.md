This is a deep dive into getting started using Prometheus in dev on macos
and enterprise production.

## How it works

From the <a target="_blank" href="https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/wzcnen">PowerPoint file animations used to create</a> this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GYe_-qqP30&t=15m14s">VIDEO</a> and diagram:<br />

brew services start prometheus && brew services start grafana

1. The core component of Prometheus is a <strong>server service</strong>. (written in <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/golang/">Golang</a>), so there are no additional VM installs like with Java, Python, etc.

1. Installers for Prometheus have been created in <a href="#Homebrew">Homebrew for macOS</a>, Ubuntu, and Windows. Commands to invoke them, along with sample configuration files are in a sample project GitHub repo. 

1. Prometheus is configured by editing the <tt>prometheus.yaml</tt> file. One comes with the installer, but you should have a customized file in each app github repo. Start the server.

1. The Prometheus server sends HTTPS GET requests to <strong>scrape</strong> (pull) metrics from <strong>target hosts</strong> defined in its <tt>targets.json</tt> file. In addition to statically-defined targets, 

   A single Prometheus server can handle up to 1,000 scrape targets.

1. Targets can be discovered by <strong>Service Discovery</strong> such as DNS, <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">Kubernetes Services</a>, or HashiCorp Consul services. The frequency of scraping and other settings are defined in the <tt>prometheus.yml</tt> file.

1. Each target interacts with Prometheus through a <a href="#Exporters">job exporter</a> service installed on each host. There is a <a href="#WMI+Exporter">WMI exporter on Windows</a> and a type of exporter on Linux, etc.

1. This can be done via an intermediary <strong>push gateway</strong> for short-lived jobs. 

1. Exporters reference <strong>custom metric providers</strong> which expose specific metrics. 

1. Unlike the legacy <tt>statsd</tt> daemon which is concerned only with system-level metrics such as CPU, Memory, etc., the tool Prometheus (at <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/">https://prometheus.io</a>) gathers metrics from targets at the cluster, node, and microservice API levels.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/46bf9d2d-2947-4e0e-94cc-131715532a21/3e05432b-7c61-4eb1-83b1-7cef861beb0b/a90d6e30-c9f1-43ee-9778-5d5824a34690">NOTE</a>: A single Prometheus server can handle up to 1,000 scrape targets, at 100,000+ samples per second. But for larger deployments, multiple Prometheus servers can be deployed in a federated architecture, with a root Prometheus server scraping data from the child servers.

1. Prometheus stores scraped samples locally in its own multi-dimensional numeric <strong>time-series database (TSDB)</strong>. 

1. <strong>Rules</strong> defined in the Prometheus TSDB can be defined with filtering and aggregate new time series from data.

   Each Prometheus server runs distributed standalone so thus not dependent on network storage or other remote services. So it's available even when other parts of the infrastructure are broken.

   PROTIP: Data on Prometheus servers should be considered <strong>short-lived (temporary)</strong> because data on it can be lost if the server is restarted. 

1. Prometheus exposes its time-series data to a variety of <strong>API clients</strong> making <a href="#PromQL">PromQL</a> (Prometheus Query Language) statements which extract data. 

1. Many enterprises have API clients go through an API Gateway to enforce strong authentication and traffic limits from specific users.

1. Data on Prometheus should be frequently sent to a long-term storage system such as AWS S3, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/microsoft-fabric/">Microsoft Fabric</a>, etc.

   PROTIP: Sending operational data to a <strong>central enterprise repository</strong> would enable a central SOC (Security Operations Center) to <strong>correlate events</strong> from throughout the enterprise and outside the enterprise. This approach does require diligence at managing disk space and retention.

1. PROTIP: To minimize training and confusion, enterprise organizations typically have a preferred set of tools for <strong>analytics</strong> processing to generate <strong>graphs</strong> and <strong>dashboards</strong> for visualization.

1. The same vendor who created Prometheus also created <a target="_blank" href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> to present <strong>dashboards</strong> to visualize data. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/46bf9d2d-2947-4e0e-94cc-131715532a21/3e05432b-7c61-4eb1-83b1-7cef861beb0b/ae204f21-9e52-4272-842b-eb155b77e3fb">NOTE</a>: Grafana can also be used to visualize data from other sources such as 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>, 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/microsoft-fabric/">Microsoft Fabric</a> running Cosmos DB, etc.
   <br /><br />

1. PROTIP: When using S3, by default, Prometheus references a static file of long-lived credentials for authentication. To prevent compromise, many organizations use a <strong>Credentials insert</strong> utility such as HashiCorp Vault which dynamically creates a new set of S3 credentials every time before running the backup.

1. PROTIP: Cloud storage mechanisms have a <strong>backup</strong> mechanism to <strong>restore</strong> data in case of failure. Practice restoring data to a new server to ensure that the backup mechanism actually works.

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/46bf9d2d-2947-4e0e-94cc-131715532a21/3e05432b-7c61-4eb1-83b1-7cef861beb0b/ae204f21-9e52-4272-842b-eb155b77e3fb">NOTE</a>: The Prometheus server can be configured to <strong>read</strong> data from remote sources -- perform <strong>remote read</strong>.

1. Because people can't be always watching dashboard screens, <a href="#Alerting-Rules">Alerting Rules</a> are set to trigger <strong>alerts</strong> pushed to the <a href="#AlertManager">Alert Manager</a> which forwards to various <strong>end-points</strong> such as email, Slack, Pager Duty, SMS, OpsGenie, or other notification mechanisms.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/46bf9d2d-2947-4e0e-94cc-131715532a21/3e05432b-7c61-4eb1-83b1-7cef861beb0b/ae204f21-9e52-4272-842b-eb155b77e3fb">NOTE</a>: In a HA configuration, alerts are sent to multiple Alert Managers (with different external labels -a and -b), which deduplicate and fan out alerts to their configured <a href="#Receivers">receivers</a>. 

1. PROTIP: To minimize training and confusion, enterprise organizations typically have a preferred set of tools for <strong>analytics</strong> processing to generate <strong>graphs</strong> and <strong>dashboards</strong> for visualization.


QUESTION: Prometheus does not collect <strong>event</strong> data from operating systems or logs emitted from applications.

The for each Prometheus:

   * /status = Run-time and build information
   * /flags = Command-line flags and their values
   * /config = The currently loaded configuration
   * /rules = Rule evaluation states

   * /target = Scrape status information for all active targets
   * /service-discovery = Service discovery status information
   * /tsdb-status = TSDB status information


## Competitors

Prometheus is born of the cloud age which can accommodate large databases.
Prometheus stores data in a standalone time series database that passively store metrics.

Prometheus differs from previous fault-detection systems, like Nagios, which run periodic check scripts but keep little historical data. Prometheus saves historical data in a Time Series Data Base (TSDB).

<a target="_blank" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/prometheus-vs-telegraf">NOTE</a>: 
The "TIK" stack (Telegraf + InfluxDB + Grafana):

* Data Collection: Prometheus is a <strong>pull-based</strong> system where it collects data by pulling metrics from targets. On the other hand, Telegraf supports both pull and push mechanisms. It can collect data by pulling metrics from various sources as well as pushing metrics to different destinations.

* Scalability: Prometheus is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data. It achieves scalability through a federated architecture where multiple Prometheus servers can be federated together. Telegraf, on the other hand, is a lightweight collector that can be deployed on a large number of machines, making it highly scalable as well.

* Data Processing: Prometheus comes with its own query language called <a href="#PromQL">PromQL</a>, which allows advanced querying and processing of metrics. With PromQL, users can perform aggregations, filtering, and math operations on the collected data. Telegraf, on the other hand, focuses more on data collection and routing, leaving the data processing task to other tools in the stack.

* Plugin Ecosystem: Telegraf has a rich plugin ecosystem, which allows easy integration with various systems and technologies. It supports a wide range of input and output plugins, making it flexible and extensible. Prometheus, on the other hand, focuses more on the core monitoring and alerting functions and has a limited number of official plugins.

* Alerting: Prometheus has a built-in alerting system that allows users to define alert rules based on the collected metrics. It supports various notification channels, such as email, Slack, and PagerDuty, to send alerts when certain conditions are met. Telegraf, on the other hand, does not have a built-in alerting system and relies on other tools in the monitoring stack for alerting functionality.

There are also Elasticsearch, Datadog, and other 
<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/siem">SIEM</a> paid solutions.

## Prometheus Origins

"Prometheus" is, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prometheus">in Ancient Greek mythology, a Titan of forethought, fire, and crafty counsel</a> -- an immortal servant of the gods. He stole fire and gave it to humankind. This changed the human race forever (for better and worse). But this made mankind dangerous to the gods. 

Ridley Scott named his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/trivia">2012 film "Prometheus"</a>, saying: "It's the story of creation; the gods and the man who stood against them." 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT4fJNbfe14">VIDEO</a>:
<a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/</a><br />
The software named Prometheus began at SoundCloud in 2012, where ex-Google SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) adopted Google's Borgmon. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1707574621/prometheus-borgmon-1856x1136_fwxjqo.png"><img alt="prometheus-borgmon-1856x1136.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1707574621/prometheus-borgmon-1856x1136_fwxjqo.png"></a>

Prometheus was open-sourced in 2015 at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases">https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases</a>

Prometheus joined the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) in 2016 as its second hosted project after Kubernetes. So as would be expected, Prometheus works with K8s.

==> Caveats
When run from `brew services`, `prometheus` is run from
`prometheus_brew_services` and uses the flags in:
   /usr/local/etc/prometheus.args
&nbsp;
To start prometheus now and restart at login:
  brew services start prometheus
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/prometheus/bin/prometheus_brew_services

1. Where was it installed?

   <pre><strong>which prometheus</strong></pre>

   On an Intel with AMD architecture chip:

   <pre>/usr/local/bin/prometheus</pre>

   On an Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 ARM architecture chip:

   <pre>/usr/local/opt/prometheus</pre>

   BTW: <tt>./prometheus</tt> (with the <tt>./</tt>) is run when you are in a folder containing the executable.
   But that's not necessary because <tt>/usr/local</tt> is typically in the operating system $PATH environment variable.

1. Verify that the executable can be reached from any folder:

   <pre><strong>prometheus --version</strong></pre>

   Response at time of writing on an AMD machine:

   <pre>prometheus, version 2.49.1 (branch: non-git, revision: non-git)

  platform:         darwin/amd64
  tags:             netgo,builtinassets,stringlabels

                                 more samples than this into memory, so this also limits the number of samples a query can return. Use with
                                 server mode only.
      --enable-feature= ...      Comma-separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels,

   ### Pre-initialize

1. Pre-initialize all important label combinations to default values when the program first starts.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://training.promlabs.com/training/instrumenting-applications/creating-and-using-metrics/using-labels-on-metrics">QUESTION</a>: Julius says: When using metrics with label dimensions, the time series for any label combination will only appear in the /metrics output once that label combination has been been accessed at least once. This can cause problems in PromQL queries that expect certain series to always be present. 

   ### Debugging errors

1. If you see errors such as this:

   <pre>

### Setup Go

<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/golang/">My instructions on how to setup Golang</a>


### Configuration

1. Identify your client machine's IP address:

1. Define storage location:

   <pre><strong>sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus</strong></pre>

1. Estimate space usage:

   size = time * sample rate * bytes per sample

1. Construct 

   Define where to store the TSDB:

   <pre><strong>--storage.tsdb.path</strong></pre>

   Define removal of data after this length of time:

   <pre><strong>--storage.tsdb.retention-time</strong></pre>

   Define removal of data after amount of space used (like in Splunk):

   <pre><strong>--storage.tsdb.retention-size</strong></pre>

   ### Upgrade data

   To ensure that data is not lost, the upgrade process is to stop the old Prometheus server, install the new version, and then start the new version.

1. PROTIP: Setup a symlink to the physical location of the binary using the <tt>ln</tt> (link) command:

   <pre>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus-2.2.0.linux-amd64/prometheus
   </pre>

   Some prefer this to renaming the downloaded file so that multiple versions can reside on the server in case response to a vulnerability requires falling back to a previous version.

1. Define a special port for versions under test:

   <pre><strong>./prometheus --web.listen-address localhost:9091</strong></pre>

1. Start Prometheus server gracefully:

   <pre><strong>systemct stop prometheus</strong></pre>

1. Run:

   <pre>./prometheus --config.file prometheus.yml</pre>



### scrape_configs

On the Prometheus server, edit the <strong>prometheus.yml</strong> file to add a new scrape_configs section to recognize the exporter on host at 172.31.122.23:

<pre>scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - "localhost:9090"
  - job_name: node
    file_sd_configs:
    - files:
      - "/etc/prometheus/file_sd/node.yml"
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['172.31.122.23:9100']
</pre>

Restart the Prometheus server to pick up the new configuration.


<hr />

## Docker

1. Confirm the creation of the existing Docker image:
 
   <pre>docker image list</pre>

   The response lists "forethought" as a Docker image.

1. List the contents of the forethought directory and subdirectories:
   
   <pre>ls -d</pre>

1. Deploy the web application to a container. Map port 8080 on the container to port 80 on the host:

   <tt>docker run --name ft-app -p 80:8080 -d forethought</tt>

1. Check that the application is working correctly by visiting the server's provided URL.

   In the script, this is done using a curl script and examining the HTML response.

1. Install

   NOTE: The Terminal is inside a Dockerized Ubuntu (18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS) image.
   So `apt-get` commands are used to install <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/2/module/329">Prometheus</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/3/module/329">Alertmanager</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/4/module/329">Grafana</a>.

   The infrastructure is monitored by using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">Prometheus's Node Exporter</a> and viewed statistic about our CPU, memory, disk, file system, basic networking, and load metrics. Also monitored are contrainers being using on virtual machines.

   Once infrastructure monitoring is up and running, the basic Node.js application uses a Prometheus client libary to track metrics across the app.

   Finally, add recording and <a href="#Alerting-Rules">alerting</a> rules, build out a series of routes so any alerts created get to their desired endpoint. 

   The course also looks at creating persistent dashboards with Grafana and use its various graphing options to better track data.

## Monitoring Kubernetes

Prometheus joined the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) in 2016 as its second hosted project after Kubernetes. So naturally, Prometheus works with K8s.

PROTIP: Prometheus has not reached "1.0" yet so use of apt-get, yum, brew, installer packages are not recommended at this time for production use. But that hasn't stopped many from using it in production.

## Starting Prometheus in Docker

To run Prometheus after downloading the Docker image from the "prom" account in Dockerhub:

   <pre><strong>docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus</strong></pre>

   Start Docker and try again if you get this error message:

   <tt>docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.</tt>

   The expected message is:

   <pre>msg="Server is ready to receive web requests."</pre>

   The location of the database and the retention period are controlled by command line options:
   Add <tt>--storage.tsdb.path</tt> for another path.
   Add <tt>--storage.tsdb.retention</tt> to specify another retention period than the default 15d (days).

2. Open a browser to see the log at:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:9090/metrics">http://localhost:9090/metrics</a> 

   There is no menu item to view the page.

3. Open a browser to see the Graph at the URL home page:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:9090/">http://localhost:9090</a>

   <img alt="prometheus-graph-menu-403x380-51898.jpg" width="403" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/41504993-ea9bcd8a-71bb-11e8-8070-72af4050c796.jpg">

   The above example are metrics for the Go language/virtual machine running locally.

   NOTE: <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">https://prometheus.io/docs</a> contains docs. It says in 2012 <strong>SoundCloud</strong> wrote Prometheus in <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/golang/">Golang</a> and open sourced it at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/prometheus/">https://github.com/prometheus</a>.

## Graphing specs

4. TODO: Select "go_gc_duration_seconds" for the median, which is 50th quantile, specified as:

   <pre>rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_samples_appended_total[1m])</pre>
   
   Also:

   <pre>go_gc_duration_seconds{instance="localhost:9090",job="prometheus",quantile="0.5"}</pre>

   See <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/">https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage</a>

5. Press Execute.
6. Click "Graph".

   Notice the granularity of timing on the horizontal axis. Thousands of a second.


   ### Configuring Prometheus.yml

5. Open a browser to 

   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:9090/config/">http://localhost:9090/config</a>

   <strong>prometheus.yml</strong> is the configuration file that contains these blocks: 
   global, <a href="#rule_files">rule_files</a>, and scrape_configs. Optionally, there are remote_read, remote_write, <a href="#Alerting-Rules">alerting</a>.

   <pre>global:
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s
   &nbsp;
    external_labels:
    environment: localhost.localdomain
   </pre>

   In the global block, scrape_interval specifies the frequency of 15s (seconds) which Prometheus scrapes targets. (The default for this is every 60 seconds)

   The /targets page shows the most recent scrape error from among all targets that cannot be scraped.

   The default evaluation_interval of 15s controls how often Prometheus evaluates rule files that specify the creation of new time series and generation of alerts.

   Its uniqueness is a <strong>rules engine</strong> that enables alerts by the Prometheus Alertmanager installed separately.

   <a name="rule_files"></a>

   ### Rules Files

5. Open a browser to 

   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:9090/rules/">http://localhost:9090/rules</a>

   Here are both recording rules and <a href="#Alerting-Rules">alerting rules</a>.

   <a name="Recording_rules"></a>

   ### Recording Rules

   <a target="_blank" href="https://training.promlabs.com/training/recording-rules/training-overview/introduction">TUTORIAL</a>:

   In the <a href="#rule_files">rule_files</a> section are yml file names. Each yml file contains groups of <strong>recording rules</strong> that define how to periodically <strong>precompute</strong> query results as new series (with a new name) in the TSDB.

   https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/rules/
   
   Each <tt>record:</strong> in a rule is executed in the sequence defined.
   Each record can, optionally, have key : value labels.
   
   The record's <tt>expr</tt> (expression) defines how to calculate the metric. 
   
   The <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/">naming conventions</a>
   for records names has three parts:

   <tt>aggregation level  :  original metric name  :  aggregation type</tt>
    (dimensional, type of rate, etc.) 

   Examples:

   <pre>- record: path:http_requests:rate5m
    expr: sum without(instance) (rate(http_requests_total{job="job1"}[5m]))
   </pre>

   * <tt>path</tt> specifies that the metric is broken up by the path label.
   * <tt>rate5m</tt> specifics a 5-minute rate.
   <br /><br />

   <pre>- record: instance_mode:node_cpu:rate1m
    expr: sum without(cpu) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{job="node"}[1m]))
    labels:
      my_label: my_value
   </pre>

   * "instance_mode:node_cpu:rate1m"
   
   QUESTION: sum without(status, instance, cpu)

   Referencing a precomputed series is less resource-intensive than repeated making the same calculations frequently for the same query. Instead of multiple dashboards referencing a series,
   recording rules can scrape metrics from one TSDB into another (to aggregate) -- to federate (share)  the result of a PromQL expression.

   To produce alerts with a custom threshold for each path's current error rate, 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.robustperception.io/using-time-series-as-alert-thresholds/">
   use time series as alert thresholds</a>. Define recording rules with the same output metric name, but different path label values. This enables different error rate thresholds to be synthetically recorded for each path of an HTTP-serving application. Then a single <a href="#Alerting-Rules">alerting rule</a> references the generated threshold metric name.

   The default interval is 1 minute. That can be changed by the <tt>global.evaluation_interval</tt> field in the Prometheus configuration file or by the rule-group-specific interval override. 

   According to Julius, During each rule evaluation cycle, Prometheus will:

   1. Evaluate the rule's PromQL expression as an instant query at the server's current timestamp,
   2. Apply label overrides (if any) to the output series,
   3. Apply sample output limits (if any) and fail the evaluation if the limit is exceeded,
   4. Store the resulting time series in the local TSDB under the provided new metric name and at the evaluation timestamp.

   <a name="AlertManager"></a>

   ## alertmanager server

   <a target="_blank" href="https://training.promlabs.com/training/alerting-with-prometheus">TRAINING</a>:

   The Prometheus Alert Manager is a separate utility server that sends alerts to various <strong>endpoints</a> when PromQL expressions in Prometheus determine when each alert needs to be sent.

   REMEMBER: Alert Rules are read by the Prometheus server (not the Alertmanager).

   An Alertmanager can receive alerts from several Prometheus servers.
   NOTE: Under development: A cluster of Alertmanager instances form a mesh configuration to ensure High Availability.

   With Prometheus, Alerting, Dashboarding and adhoc querying all act from a TSDB.

   ### alertmanager install

   I've automated the install of with this Bash script.
   The latest version is automatically identified and renamed to just "alertmanager".

   <pre>run.sh
   </pre>

   ### alertmanager config

   In the alertmanager.yml file, define the Alertmanager server:

   <pre>alerting:
   alertmanagers:
   - scheme: https
      static_configs:
      - targets:
         - "localhost:9093"
   </pre>

   REMEMBER: Alertmanager uses port 9093 by default.

   Docker setup

   defaults:
   * group_wait: 30s = how long buffer alerts in same group waits before initial notification
   * group_interval: 5m = how long before new alert notification sent to group already notified
   * repeat_interval: 4h = How long before re-sending notification for same alert

   <a name="Alerting-Rules"></a>

   ### Alerting Rules

   Based on samples <a target="_blank" href="https://training.promlabs.com/training/alerting-with-prometheus/understanding-alerting-rules/alerting-rules-overview">from Julius</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/36f40310-1a7a-45fd-802d-4429136c32ca/86d5ccce-5849-4633-bc5d-cdb23201f8f9/ede1076b-6ca0-4a6a-8d68-6c5a8c59a3a3">Craig</a>:

      (
        sum by(path, instance, job) (
          rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{status=~"5..",job="demo"}[1m])
        )
      /
        sum by(path, instance, job) (
          rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{job="demo"}[1m])
        ) * 100 > 0.5
      )
    for: 5m                 # How long each result time series needs to be present to become a firing alert.
    labels:                 # Extra labels to attach for routing.

   </pre>

   The 2nd alerting rule generates critical alerts for any path/instance/job label combinations that have an error rate larger than 0.5% for at least 5 minutes.

   ### amtool

   Alertmanager doesn't start if default route is not specified.

   <pre><strong>./amtool check-config alertmanager.yml
   </strong></pre>

   ### Scrape configs

   This defines the job that <strong>scrapes</strong> the Prometheus web UI:

   <pre>
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'prometheus'
       metrics_path: "/metrics"
       static_configs:
       - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: node
    file_sd_configs:
    - files:
      - "/etc/prometheus/file_sd/node.yml"
   </pre>

   There can be several jobs named in a config, named x, y, and z in the sample config file.

   ### Silence

1. When working on an issue, silence notifications.

1. When fixed, <strong>expire</strong. silence.

1. Previous silenced alarts can be reactivated for a period of time.

## Local start

Alternately,

   PROTIP: Using <tt>/etc/prometheus</tt> would require sudo, but ~/.prometheus would not.

1. Create a folder to hold the Prometheus configuration file, then CD to it:

   <pre>cd ~ ; mkdir .prometheus ; cd .prometheus</pre>

2. Create a Prometheus configuration file in the folder or copy in then edit a full template example at:

   https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.3/config/testdata/conf.good.yml

3. Validate <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml syntax</a> online:

   https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint

4. Validate for content using the promtool in the Prometheus bin folder:

   <pre><strong>promtool check config prometheus.yml</strong></pre>

   An example error message is:

   <pre>Checking prometheus.yml
  FAILED: parsing YAML file prometheus.yml: yaml: line 13: did not find expected '-' indicator
   </pre>

   The expected response is: "SUCCESS: 0 rule files found".

5. To run Prometheus locally in the directory containing the Prometheus binary:

   	<pre><strong>./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml</strong></pre>


   Additional parameters, for example:

   <pre>level=info ts=2017-10-23T14:03:02.274562Z caller=main.go:216 msg="Starting prometheus"...</pre>

## App Metrics

<a target="_blank" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems.html#xref_monitoring_golden-signals">
The four golden signals of monitoring</a> begins with:

* <strong>Latency</strong>

   The time it takes to service a request. It’s important to distinguish between the latency of successful requests and the latency of failed requests. For example, an HTTP 500 error triggered due to loss of connection to a database or other critical backend might be served very quickly; however, as an HTTP 500 error indicates a failed request, factoring 500s into your overall latency might result in misleading calculations. On the other hand, a slow error is even worse than a fast error! Therefore, it’s important to track error latency, as opposed to just filtering out errors.

* <strong>Traffic</strong>

   A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system, measured in a high-level system-specific metric. For a web service, this measurement is usually HTTP requests per second, perhaps broken out by the nature of the requests (e.g., static versus dynamic content). For an audio streaming system, this measurement might focus on network I/O rate or concurrent sessions. For a key-value storage system, this measurement might be transactions and retrievals per second.

   To identify bottlenecks, instead of beginning with given metrics (partial answers) and trying to work backwards,
   the Utilization Saturation and Errors (USE) Method by Brendan Gregg (of Netflix), described at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html">http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html</a>,  begins by posing questions off a checklist, and then seeks answers. To direct the construction of a checklist, which for server analysis can be used for quickly identifying resource bottlenecks or errors.

* <strong>Utilization</strong> 

   the average time that the resource was busy servicing work.

* <strong>Errors</strong>

   The rate of requests that fail, either explicitly (e.g., HTTP 500s), implicitly (for example, an HTTP 200 success response, but coupled with the wrong content), or by policy (for example, "If you committed to one-second response times, any request over one second is an error"). Where protocol response codes are insufficient to express all failure conditions, secondary (internal) protocols may be necessary to track partial failure modes. Monitoring these cases can be drastically different: catching HTTP 500s at your load balancer can do a decent job of catching all completely failed requests, while only end-to-end system tests can detect that you’re serving the wrong content.

* <strong>Saturation</strong>

   How "full" your service is. A measure of your system fraction, emphasizing the resources that are most constrained (e.g., in a memory-constrained system, show memory; in an I/O-constrained system, show I/O). Note that many systems degrade in performance before they achieve 100% utilization, so having a utilization target is essential. In complex systems, saturation can be supplemented with higher-level load measurement: can your service properly handle double the traffic, handle only 10% more traffic, or handle even less traffic than it currently receives? For very simple services that have no parameters that alter the complexity of the request (e.g., "Give me a nonce" or "I need a globally unique monotonic integer") that rarely change configuration, a static value from a load test might be adequate. As discussed in the previous paragraph, however, most services need to use indirect signals like CPU utilization or network bandwidth that have a known upper bound. Latency increases are often a leading indicator of saturation. Measuring your 99th percentile response time over some small window (e.g., one minute) can give a very early signal of saturation.

Predictive: saturation is the basis for projections of impending issues, such as "at the current rate, your database will fill its hard drive in 4 hours."

## App Instrumentation

"Instrumentation" is the process of adding code to your application so it exposes metrics to Prometheus.

Prometheus <strong>scrapes</strong> metrics from apps setup to expose <strong>exposition metrics</a> through a <tt>/metrics</tt> path.

<a target="_blank" href="https://training.promlabs.com/training/instrumenting-applications/training-overview/introduction">PROTIP</a>: For insight over what is happening inside your application or library: Julius recommends direct instrumentation: track and expose Prometheus metrics directly from your own applications and services rather than using exporters for code.

### MySQL setup

1. For the MySQL prompt:

   <pre><strong>mysql -u root -p</strong></pre>

1. Create a database user for the exporter to use.
1. Grant permissions
1. Provide credentials to exporter
<br /><br />

<pre>CREATE USER 'mysqld_exporter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 3; 
GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, SELECT ON *.* TO 'mysqld_exporter'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
export DATA_SOURCE_NAME='mysqld_exporter:password@(localhost:3306)/';

## Metric types

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhx0ehppMGM" title="Understanding Prometheus Metric Types | Meaning and Usage (Gauge, Counter, Summary, Histogram">VIDEO</a>:  by Julius. <a target="_blank" href="https://promlabs.com/blog/">Julius' blog</a>

* <strong>Counters</strong> increments

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxZmn4svOyA&t=6m30s">VIDEO</a>: 
   Counters track the total number of metrics Prometheus has ingested so far:
   PROTIP: Metrics that keep going up and up in a graph would eventually blow up. So it's better reported as a <strong>rate per minute</strong>. 
   To define the 90th percentile value on a histogram:
   &nbsp;
   <pre><strong>histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by(le, path) rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])</strong></pre>

* <strong>Gauges</strong> tally

   Guages tally values that naturally go up and down, such as the temperature, amount of gasoline in vehicles or capacity of memory and CPU used, and the length of items in queues awaiting processing.
   Each guage has a maximum capacity and usually a minimum of zero.

   An exposition format:

   <pre># HELP process_open_fds Number of open file descriptors.
# TYPE process_open_fds gauge
process_open_fds 15
   </pre>

* <strong>histogram</strong> count of value buckets

   Histograms report a count of <strong>how many</strong> were observed within each bucket of a distribution. As Prometheus receives readings such as request duration (latency), it arranges them by value in an object setup for that work.

   When it comes time to publish, the value of each item observed is the basis for them to be counted within several buckets. If 6 buckets are used, the exposition would have 6 lines.

   <pre># HELP http_request_duration_seconds A histogram of the request duration.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.025"} 20
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 60
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 90
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.25"} 100
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 105
http_request_duration_seconds_sum 21.322
http_request_duration_seconds_count 105
   </pre>

   We don't want to specify buckets by the values because that changes over time.
   So we specify the buckets using a <strong>frequency of occurrence</strong> number between 0 and 1.0 (expressed as "+Inf" for infinity, which covers the values observed in the bucket containing the highest values). A 0.5 would cover 50% of the values.

   The frequency number is specified in "le" (less than or equal to) a number to the previous bucket.

   Histograms provide a count of <strong>outliers</strong> when request durations (latencies) are too slow. Alerts would trigger if the number in the highest bucket exceeds a specified occurrence.

   Julius notes that when aggregating across dimensions (such as endpoint, HTTP method, etc.) use histogram rather than summary. He explains why in his tutorial.

* <strong>Summary</strong> quartiles

   "Quartiles" is a misnomer because it doesn't really mean quarters. 
   
   Quartiles in Prometheus summary metric types are really percentiles, but specified in a 0 to 1 scale rather than 0 to 100 as normally specified in the industry.

   <pre># HELP rpc_duration_seconds A summary of RPC durations in seconds.
# TYPE rpc_duration_seconds summary
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.01"} 3.102
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.05"} 3.272
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 4.773
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} 9.001
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"} 76.656
rpc_duration_seconds_sum 5.7560473e+04
rpc_duration_seconds_count 2693
   </pre>

   The lowest quartile may indicate durations that are too low, such as when an error occured.

   To create a summary, this from Julius to specify percentiles:

   <pre>requestDurations := prometheus.NewSummary(prometheus.SummaryOpts{
    Name:       "http_request_duration_seconds",
    Help:       "A summary of the HTTP request durations in seconds.",
    Objectives: map[float64]float64{
      0.5: 0.05,   // 50th percentile with a max. absolute error of 0.05.
      0.9: 0.01,   // 90th percentile with a max. absolute error of 0.01.
      0.99: 0.001, // 99th percentile with a max. absolute error of 0.001.
    },
  },
)

Turnbull suggests monitoring for "correctness", not just their status, starting with business metrics, then application (https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems.html#xref_monitoring_golden-signals), then operating system metrics to avoid "cargo cult" delusions. An example is monitoring for rates of business transactions rather than server uptime.

Infrastructure and application monitoring using Prometheus</a>  at Devox UK May 17, 2017
by Marco Pas

LinuxAcademy video hands-on courses: 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/1/module/329">Monitoring Infrastructure and Containers with Prometheus</a>: Prometheus is used to monitor infrastructure and applications at multiple levels: on the host itself, on any containers, and on the application. This hands-on lab addresses monitoring of virtual machine host and containers. It begins by setting up monitoring for a virtual machine using Prometheus's Node Exporter. Then set up container monitoring for the provided container using Google's <strong>cAdvisor</strong>. 

   View metrics in Prometheus across two levels of a system to track changes and view trends.

references an <a target="_blank" href="https://interactive.linuxacademy.com/diagrams/ProjectForethought.html">interactive Lucid diagram called "ProjectForethought"</a> for the NodeJs simple to-do list program called Forethought that is the subject of monitoring. 

   Create within Linux Academy's <a target="_blank" href="https://playground.linuxacademy.com/server-list">Servers in the cloud</a>, the "DevOps Monitoring Deep Dive" distribution in a small-sized host. It contains a Dockerized Ubuntu (18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS).

   So `apt-get` commands are used to install <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/2/module/329">Prometheus</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/3/module/329">Alertmanager</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/4049/lesson/4/module/329">Grafana</a>.

   <tt>docker run --name ft-app -p 80:8080 -d forethought</tt>

   The infrastructure is monitored by using Prometheus's Node Exporter and viewed statistic about our CPU, memory, disk, file system, basic networking, and load metrics. Also monitored are contrainers being using on virtual machines.

   Once infrastructure monitoring is up and running, the basic Node.js application uses a Prometheus client libary to track metrics across the app.

   Finally, add recording and alerting rules, build out a series of routes so any alerts created get to their desired endpoint. 

   The course also looks at creating persistent dashboards with Grafana and use its various graphing options to better track data.

## /tsdb_status

The TSDB Status page shows detailed statistics about individual metric names and labels:

* Top 10 <strong>label names with value count</strong> is used if some unintentional high-cardinality data (like public user IPs or full HTTP paths) are stored in label values, you will immediately see those problematic labels at the top here.

* Top 10 <strong>label names with high memory usage</strong> helps to identify label names that may not have a too high number of values associated with them, but where individual values are overly large and memory-consuming.

* Top 10 <strong>series count by metric names</strong> - to track down metric names that overall have a combination of labels attached to them that cause a large number of time series.

* Top 10 <strong>series count by label value pairs</strong> when a specific label combination at the top here, like a histogram metric name (__name__="my_histogram_bucket") that has a lot of bucket time series attached.
