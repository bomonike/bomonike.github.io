WARNING: There is a massive amount of information about Azure. Most YouTube videos about <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/azure-certifications/">certifications</a> only scratch the surface of all that is needed to get an enterprise up and running. Many tutorials demonstrate unsafe or inefficient practices with toy examples not suitable for production usage.

This article is what I've learned so far about how an initial administrator gets started in Azure with a starter account to create a global enterprise. Updates on this are sure to follow as I learn more and as Azure evolves.

> PROTIP: Here, all in one page, are the <strong>hands-on</strong>, <a href="#Automation">automation</a> and OCM (Organizational Change Management) steps needed to build Azure for a <strong>whole global enterprise</strong> to minimize manual toil and add secure practices and mechanisms within workflows.

## Enterprise Adoption Sequence

PHASES:

1.  <a href="#PHASE01"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>First, we describe how the first person working on behalf of an enterprise -- the initial <a href="#Global+Administrator">Global Administrator</a> -- supplies an email to the Azure Portal GUI to get a <a href="#Starter+Account">Starter Azure</a> with an initial <a href="#Subscription">Subscription</a>. The default "User Access Admin" role can make any change, so a working set of roles need to be created, using the portal GUI. Skill at this are tested by Microsoft's <a href="#AZ-104">AZ-104</a> certification exam.

2.  <a href="#PHASE02"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Global Admins prepare versioned <strong>automation</strong>, aligned with training assets, to securely setup workstations (laptops) for other admins.

    Automation can make it more necessary to follow <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming">naming conventions</a> by constructing Resource names from various elements.

3.  <a href="#PeopleInfo"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Working within an enterprise requires an understanding of all the <strong>people involved</strong>: who reports to whom in the people organization, their job titles, and responsibilities, with metadata about each person (such as their geographic location, emails, phone number, carrier for SMS, GitHub account, etc.). This background metadata determines what <a href="#IAM">IAM</a> (Identity and Access Management) and Privileged Access Management structures need to be set up.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2023/07/11/microsoft-entra-new-products.aspx">In 2023</a> Microsoft renamed from "Azure AD" (for Azure Active Directory) with <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/compare">Microsoft Entra ID</a> to reference its "Identity as a Service (IDaaS)" solution (like Okta) for apps across cloud and on-premises.

    NOTE: An Azure Resource exists in only one Resource Group (to store metadata). A Resource Group can have resources from different Regions and Subscriptions. <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources">Moving resources</a> between Resource Groups is possible, but not between Subscriptions. 
    
4.  <a href="#Payments"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Admins would work with <strong>Finance</strong> to work through financial workflows and oversight of the <strong>Payments</strong> for <strong>billings</strong> associated with each <a href="#Subscription">Subscription</a> and <a href="#Licenses">licenses</a>. Bills are paid for by <strong>credit cards or invoices</strong> set through a Microsoft salesperson or Cloud Service Provider.

5.  <a href="#Licenses"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>PROTIP: A firm decision on what <strong>Licenses</strong> the enterprise will pay for can (contiunually) minimizes rework in automation efforts and workflow documentation. A <a href="#P1vsP2">P2</a> license for each user is needed for enterprises to use Azure securely. Among P2 features are MFA (Multi-Factor) verification, a crucial security feature.

6.  <a href="#PHASE06"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Use of <a href="#IaC">automation</a> makes it quicker and more reliable to create resources because written enables teamwork and confirmation enables back-tracing. There are several options for automation within Azure: <strong>Bicep</strong> declarative statements are transpiled to YAML-formatted contents into the JSON format of <strong>ARM templates</strong>. 

Microsoft is shifting from Terraform. 

Also, Microsoft has stopped development of its <a href="#Blueprints">"Blueprints"</a>) in favor of <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-specs?tabs=azure-powershell">Template Specs</a>).

    <a href="#PHASE18"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a><strong>DevSecOps</strong> CI/CD runs.

7.  <a href="#PHASE07"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a><strong>IaC Policies</strong> aim to identify vulnerabilities and logic errors before resources are deployed and thus possibly exposed. 

8.  <a href="#PHASE08"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>  Because it takes some effort to configure each resource according to <strong>documentation</strong> for each service, an important part of automation is to <strong>audit</strong> scripts. 

9. <a href="#PHASE09"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a><strong>other System Administrators</strong> from within the people organization are selected, assigned, and <strong>trained</strong> to be setup and trained by Global Admins to use automation.

    Administrators are the "gate-keepers" who define IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to setup technical "guardrails" that limit <strong>Actions</strong> operating on <strong>Resource</strong>. 

10. <a href="#Administrators"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"><strong>System Administrators</strong></a> implement for the portion assigned to them <strong>Roles</strong> needed to perform <strong>Actions</strong> on <strong>Resources</strong> within <strong>Scopes</strong> defined.

    Automatic resource deletion locks are set to prevent one group deleting resources needed by another, such as an ExpressRoute circuit with connectivity back on the on-premises network.

11. <a href="#PHASE11"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"><strong>End Users</strong></a> on Entra are usually provisioned by responding to requests from <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision">external HR systems</a> such as Workday, SuccessFactors, Oracle Peoplesoft.

12. <a href="#PHASE12"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>When MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is available for each user, users can register their mobile <strong>Devices</strong> for <strong>identity verification</strong>.

13. <a href="#PHASE13"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-learn-about-groups">Using groups</a> enables Administrators to assign a set of access permissions to all members of the group. 

    P2 licenses enable users to automatically be joined to <strong>Security Groups</strong> dynamically, which saves manual time and effort in assigning Roles and Policies to each User.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management">Users can individually request to join groups</a> to gain access. This would require individual approvals as well.

14. <a href="#PHASE14"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Azure provides a <strong>RBAC</strong> (Role-based Access Control) mechanism defined by: the <strong>profile</strong> defined for each <strong>A. Security Principals</strong> limited by <strong>B. Role Definitions</strong> assigned to <strong>C. Scopes</strong> around resources.

    As for <strong>Role Definitions</strong>: A P2 license enables <strong>custom roles</strong> to be defined in addition to <strong>built-in</strong> roles that apply to <strong>Security Principals</strong>.

    REMEMBER: Roles are about what users do: <strong>data owners</strong> assign users to groups. <strong>data users</strong> add and update data. <strong>data custodians</strong> move and protect data.

    Roles relate to the <strong>task</strong> relevant to <strong>assets</strong>:

    <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
    <tr><th> _JobTitle </th><th> _AssetRole </th></tr>
    <tr valign="top"><td> Payroll Supervisor </td><td> Payroll metrics </td></tr>
    <tr valign="top"><td> Payroll Clerk </td><td> Process Payroll </td></tr>
    <tr valign="top"><td> HR Operations </td><td> Create Payroll Backups </td></tr>
    <tr valign="top"><td> Operations Clerk </td><td> Restore Payroll Backups </td></tr>
    <tr valign="top"><td> Archive Manager </td><td> Delete Payroll Backups </td></tr>
    </table>

    <strong>Scopes assigned</strong> to specific Roles are about the attributes of resources.

    Each Scope is defined as a leaf of a <strong>hierarchy</strong> that consists of a Subscription under a <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview"><strong>Management Group</strong></a> so each Administrator has their own group to manage.

    A set of files are in an <strong>Azure Stack</strong> folder. Each Stack creates a set of coordinated resources for a particular Scope. 

    <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696792519/azure-org-1758x916_sbaptk.png"><img alt="azure-org-1758x916.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696792519/azure-org-1758x916_sbaptk.png"><br /><em>Click image for full screen</em></a>.

    The hierarchy defines the path of <strong>escalation</strong> if alerts are not addressed on a timely manner.

    The hierarchy also defines which supervisor takes over if an Administrator is not available. 

    To ensure that it's intentional, the more secure enterprises restrict <strong>deletion actions</strong> to be performed only by the administrator above the administrator of a cell in the diagram. 
    
    The work of the "MyCo" Administrator at the top is largely <strong>financial</strong> - aggregating bills for <a href="#Enterprise+discounts">enterprise volume discount</a> reconciliation with the cloud vendor. This team would have the statistics to partner with technical people on cost minimization efforts.

    Inadvertant <strong>Deletion</strong> of data can be disastrous. So it helps to have a specialist centrally setup and manage mechanisms for that. For example, individual users who do not have delete permissions can <strong>reassign</strong> obsolete resources to "Decommissioned". This is to avoid accidental deletion of resources and enable central review before deletion.

    Most enterprises today have a central SOC (Security Operations Center) to monitor and quickly respond to incidents in Production environments ("PRD").

    The Operations ("Ops") team builds complete Staging ("STG") environment to conduct systems capacity testing and chaos engineering once the QA team has tested individual components. Each of these teams can be from under different Vice Presidents, to serve as liaisons to those other organizations.

    For <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1diCL35orX9cVEgti1eU7aaG_sgyDSPmbQjnXBamUnVc/edit?usp=sharing">example</a>, virtual machines (VMs) in a particular Management Group can be limited to being created in <strong>specific regions</strong> (soverignties). Policies for each management group apply to all nested management groups, subscriptions, and resources.

    ### Paired region backup

    Boxes within dotted lines represents the <strong>paired region</strong> where Azure automatically sends back up data so they can restore everything in case of disaster in any given region. This is a major differentiator for Azure versus AWS which makes each customer do their own backup and recovery. 
    
15. <a href="#PHASE15"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>Management Groups usually map to the people Organization.

    PROTIP: Our automation includes using a spreadsheet to define the hierarchy, and loading that into Azure, for both samples in test and to prepare for productive use.

    The design begins from the top of the chart at the root of the Tenant Entra ID directory because that's where Scopes are stored.

16. Entra elevate

    <a href="#PHASE16"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>PROTIP: Azure makes it such that a Global Admin make changes to Management Groups after signing into Entra to give themselves the "User Access Admin" role. 

    To minimize mistakes and abuse at enterprise scale, <strong>repeatability</strong> is needed to efficiently set up a whole enterprise full of users and resources. That's why <strong>IaC (Infrastructure as Code)</strong> automation is needed.

17. <a href="#PHASE14"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>The <strong>Provider</strong> to each service used needs to be <strong>Registered</strong>. For example, use of Entra ID B2C needs to be registered to an Entra ID Tenant.

Since Resource Groups being created must specify a Subscription, Azure knows how to bill for each Resource.

19. <a href="#PHASE19"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a>The most common policy check in IaC is to ensure that <a href="#Tags">Tags</a> are included with every resource so that  billing, disposal, and other aspects of every resource are defined.
 
    PROTIP: IaC Policies and Policy Definitions should ensure that each Resource in the DEV environment contain at least one Tag for billing. In Production, each Resource should be defined with several Tags.

20. <a href="#PHASE20"><img align="right" width="30" height="30" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1696347985/icon-info-2000x2000_s4f16e.png"></a><strong>Policy Definitions</strong> are defined in JSON files that define rules assigned by resource Scope.

## Summary of Automation

   * <strong>mac-setup.sh</strong> for <strong>laptop setup</strong> -- installing everything needed on your mac with a single command. Then it makes runs simple to repeat and optionally cleans up after runs.

   * <strong>org-gen.py</strong> generates csv files containing sample values for an organization with a size of your choosing. (100, 1000, 10000, etc.). The data describes a hierarchy of departments, jobs, roles, groups, people, projects, etc. used as the basis for assigning Least-Privilege permissions to resources.

   * <strong>org-chart.py</strong> generates an organization chart graphic from a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EuIGw_qY9TgrGxcpll2WBoYpJJotJh-vUcZpSngYmUs/edit?usp=sharing">csv spreadsheet file</a>.

<a name="BrowserProfiles"></a>

### Setup & Use Browser Profiles

Websites (including Azure) store your browser history, what account you logged in, etc. locally in "cookies" associated with your browser account.

That's how you get returned to the last account used when you go back to a website.

PROTIP: Setup <strong>different browser profiles</strong> on the same browser, associated with different profile avatars and colors: <strong>one for each account (email)</strong>.

1. Click your browser's avatar picture at the upper-right corner:

   * The <a href="#MSAccount">Learn account</a> using your personal email (such as at gmail.com).
   * The account associated with your Visual Studio benefit (using your work email)
   * Each of your work accounts (to do your job as an Administrator).
   <br /><br />

1. Do the above for each browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc.).


<a name="Payments"></a>

### Free Subscriptions


DEFINITION: A "Subscription" in Azure is the account for <strong>billing</strong> to payment options such as a credit card or invoice account setup with a Microsoft salesperson.

* Some "Exercises" in Microsoft Learn provide FREE "MICROSOFT LEARN SANDBOX" temporary "Concierge" subscription access one or two hours at a time. 

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure/3-exercise-create-a-vm">Create Windows Virtual Machine</a>
   <br /><br />

* <a target="_blank" href="https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/devopsserver/handsonlabs/">azuredevopslabs.com/labs/devopsserver/handsonlabs</a> with code at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredevopslabs/tree/master/labs/devopsserver/handsonlabs/">github.com/Microsoft/azuredevopslabs/tree/master/labs/devopsserver/handsonlabs</a>, which provides a quick and easy way to evaluate and test (currently only DevOps and Visual Studio) through virtual environments that do not require any complex setup or installation. You can use virtual labs online immediately for free :)

* Search for others in Microsoft's LEARN website:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/">
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/</a>

* Microsoft offers free student accounts at:

   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/

* CloudAcademy.com licenses include Lab time in some of their monthly subscriptions.

   * <a href="#CloudAcademyLab">VM lab</a>
   <br /><br />


<a name="SignUp"></a>

### Subscription Offers (deals)

* Get a "Microsoft Learn" account for $200 of credits to spend in 30 days and also a year of <a href="#FreeSvcs">free services</a>. See <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/">docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/</a> 

   After that instead of "Pay-As-You-Go",

* PROTIP: Obtain Azure credits as a benefit of a monthly license of Visual Studio (even though they don't intend on using the IDE). Azure Subscriptions (like Netflix, Disney+, etc.) are billed monthly.

   * $50/month credits from a $39/mo Visual Studio Professional license
   * $150/month credits from a $79/mo Visual Studio Enterprise license
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Visual Studio Subscriptions are, as of this writing, NOT offered in the Brazil South and Central India regions, as noted in <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/</a>.

* "BizSpark" is Microsoft's effort to encourage start-ups.

* CSP (consultants) may charge less than Microsoft due to incentives provided.

* "Enterprise Agreement Support" are billed using invoices.

* Consumer sign up for Azure:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://signup.live.com/signup"><strong>
   https://signup.live.com/signup</strong></a>

   SECURITY PROTIP: Use address with a zip code that's not associated with your home address, and not used for banking.

   PROTIP: Microsoft does not force consumers to pay for a subscription with a credit card until <strong>5 or more users</strong> or initial free vouchers are used up.

   PROTIP: Microsoft no longer accepts debit cards such as from Walmart <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bluebird.com/">Bluebird</a> VISA card (by American Express).
   
   PROTIP: Create a separate card sub-account for each cloud account.

### Support

1. See the list of support tickets <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview">here</a>


<a name="MSAccount"></a>

### Email

PROTIP: Avoid using an email that you use for your own banking, shopping, social media, etc. For continuity with a real cloud, you'll need an email address that you can share and transfer to other people. That's so at a company, you will need to give someone else the password so that if you're ever go on vacation (or get run over or thrown under a bus), your organization can continue.

   In you're in an enterprise company, get an email adddress from a corporate assets administrator. A different (service) account is often created for each department of responsibility.

   PROTIP: In the name include the month and year in the account name (such as johndoe1901@hotmail.com) for 2019-01 (January). Many <strong>create several email accounts</strong> because each Azure subscription includes a $200 credit to spend on any service for the <strong>first 30 days</strong>, free access to <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/">Azure products for 12 months</a>. 


<a name="Entra"></a>

### Entra (Azure Active Directory/Azure AD/AAD)

   In 2023, Microsoft rebranded "Azure Active Directory (AAD)" or "Azure AD" to <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name">Microsoft Entra ID</a>. [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThT3n2Yass4">VIDEO</a>]

   > The word "entra" means "entrance" (enter in) in Italian. It's a nod to the fact that Microsoft Entra ID is the gateway to Microsoft 365 and Azure services.

   When someone signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription (such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Microsoft Intune, etc.), a dedicated instance of <strong>Entra (Azure AD)</strong> is created automatically.

   * Number of MFA denials to trigger account lockout (from 1 to 99)
   * Minutes until account lockout counter is reset (from 1 to 1440)
   * Minutes until account is automatically unlocked (from 1 to 9999)
   <br /><br />


<a name="P1vsP2"></a>

   * Risk level and risk detail fields are hidden to those with just the Entra ID Premium P1 edition.
   * Advanced detections (such as unfamiliar sign-in properties) not covered by license appear under the name Sign-in with additional risk detected. 
   * Privileged identity management (PIM)
   <br /><br />

<strong>Premium P2</strong> (included in Microsoft 365 E5) includes all P1 features plus really cool <strong>"Identity Protection"</strong> with policies Assignment to all users.
   * Identity governance/protection dashboard
   * Risk-based Conditional Access (sign-in risk, user risk)

   The new <strong>$7/person Microsoft Entra ID Governace</strong> offering adds:
   * Identity governance dashboard
   * Entitlement management with Verified ID
   * Lifecycle workflows
   * <strong>Machine learning assisted</strong> access certifications and reviews
   <br /><br />

   * Multi-factor authentication registration policy to Require MFA

   * User risk remediation policy to require password change, with review of number of users impacted

   * Sign-in remediation policy to automate analysis of signals from each sign-in, both real-time and offline, and calculates a risk score based on the probability that the sign-in wasn't performed by the user. Administrators can decide based on this risk score signal to enforce organizational requirements. Administrators can choose to block access, allow access, or allow access but require multi-factor authentication. If risk is detected, users can perform multi-factor authentication to self-remediate and close the risky sign-in event to prevent unnecessary noise for administrators.

   * Investigate risks using data in the portal.

   * Export risk detection data to third-party utilities for further analysis.

   Users on another Entra ID (B2B) or public IDP (B2C).

   ### GUI Navigation Hubs, Panes, Blades

   DEFINITION: A <strong>Hub</strong> is a category for navigation within the left Azure Portal menu that is opened by clicking the upper-left accordion icon alt.

   Panes that appear on the right are called "blades".
   A <strong>Blade</strong> is a portion of the page that pops up as you navigate in the portal. (Note: A Blade is <strong>contextual</strong> and tied to your navigation. This will become more intuitive as you use the portal.) 

   Opening a series of blades is called a <strong>journey</strong>.


   ### Dock hamburger menu

1. Click the "hamburger" (home) icon at the upper-left corner for English descriptions of each icon on the left edge.

1. Click the "<" icon at top of the separator to collapse ("dock") or expand the text of services listed on the left menu.

   <a name="Keyboard_Shortcuts"></a>
   
   ### Left Dock Keyboard Shortcuts

1. PROTIP: To keep things simple, I arrange the FAVORITES menu item alphabetically.

   1. App Services
   2. Advisor
   3. Entra ID
   4. Cost Management + Billing
   5. Function App
   6. Load balancers
   7. Monitor
   8. Security Center
   9. Storage Accounts
   11. (0) Virtual Machines
   <br /><br />

1. ??? Click the <img width="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benc-uk/icon-collection/master/azure-cds/command-1094-Favorite.svg">star icon so it is gold to enable the service to show on the menu or unselect to remove the service from the bar.

   <img width="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benc-uk/icon-collection/master/azure-cds/general-17-Home.svg">Home

1. Drag and drop the Categories in a stable sequence and position you can mouse to quickly:

   Example: I drag the "Billing" icon to the top because I manage the money involved.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0uXwdLDzf4">VIDEO</a> 
   PROTIP: If you memorize the number of your menu, you'll never need to mouse to the "hamberger" menu again, avoid being distracted by menu text, and recover screen real estate.

1. Hold down G and press a number to view one of the first 10 menu items.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha2ESFCcERQ&list=PLWag0-UcFD4HacGTnNVUzUMIsIF1CXySQ&index=15" title="Dec 5, 2019">VIDEO</a>: Many find themselves more productive when they don't have to reach for the mouse. Keeping hands on the keyboard reduces a distraction. Thus, it's impressive wizardry during demos.

1. Click the "?" at the top of the page to click <u>Keyboard shortcuts</u>. 

   In there and in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-keyboard-shortcuts">DOCS</a>, "G+." means <strong>while holding down the G key</strong>, press the period key, which puts the focus on the ">>" icon so you can press Enter to expand or contract the left menu. Press Tab to cycle down the menu.

   PROTIP: You can use the G key as if it's like the Command/Ctrl key because you're not filling out a form. If you see G appear in a form fill field (such as the browser URL), backspace to clear the field, then press Tab off the form fields and try again.

1. Press Esc to escape from the help window.

1. A reminder of the G key is always present at the top of every Azure screen:<br />
   "Search resources, services, and docs (G+/)", which means hold down G and press / to search.

   <a name="FullScreen"></a>

   ### Full screen toggle

1. To toggle a window to take up the <strong>whole screen</strong> on Windows PCs: press F11 or Alt+Enter or Windows key + up-arrow. On macOS: hold down the command on the right, control on the left, then F (control+command+F). Repeat the keys to un-maximize. This is equivalent to clicking the green "maximize" icon on the upper-left of each app window or double-clicking on the app's title bar. 

   CAUTION: Any window maximized will not be brought up by the keyboard shortcut which cycles through various windows within the app (command+` on macOS; Alt+Tab on Windows PCs). To see the maximized window, you have to cursor near the top edge until the app's menu appears, then pull down the browser's Window menu.

   QUESTION: How to toggle full screen in Azure like on Netflix, which removes menus, breadcrumbs, and command bar? Alt+Space+X on Windows.

1. Switch among windows command+` (at the upper-left corner of the keyboard).
1. To find text on the page, press command+F.

<a name="PHASE09"></a>
<a name="Administrators"></a>

## PHASE 02. Administrators

In security, there is a distinction between "data owners" and "data custodians" (who manage the data).
An inventory needs to be maintained about who has type of access to what data, for escalations and approvals.
   * The Business Managers who own apps and the data they contain.
   * The IT Managers who manage the infrastructure (servers, storage, network, etc.) on which the apps run.
   * The Administrators who manage the apps and the data they contain.
   <br /><br />

In Azure, there is a distinction between "subscription owners" and "subscription administrators" (who manage the subscription).

    Microsoft's "Security Service Edge (SSE)" solution facilitates applying Conditional access policies across organizational resources and apps.

    REMEMBER: Azure itself does not allow Global Administrators to be used for production work. Instead, <strong>Conditional Access</strong> is used to grant permissions to users and groups.

<a name="Occupations"></a>

### Technical Occupation Groups

Microsoft has defined their <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/azure-certifications">Azure certification exams</a> based on these generic occupations:

   * (Azure) Administrator (of IAM, etc.)
   * (Azure) Developer
   * (Azure) Solution Architect

   * Data Engineer
   * AI Engineer

   * Business Analyst
   * Business User (Dynamics, Salesforce, etc.)
   <br /><br />

PROTIP: This grouping is different from the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles">Administrator role permissions in Entra</a> (formerly Azure Active Directory).

   MY OPINION: I think job roles should be multi-select checkboxes.
   This segregation also adds to duplicating material for each.

   QUESTION: How can these occupational roles be added among properties for individual users?

<a name="Tenants"></a>

## Tenants

   The Azure SaaS service separates different customers into different <strong>tenants</strong> (like tenants in an apartment building). Each tenant is a dedicated, isolated instance of the AAD/Entra service, owned and managed by an organization. 

   "Isolated" = ISE

   Entra ID supports auth protocols: OAuth, OpenID, SAML, WS-Federation.

2. For birthdate, make up an adult year: 2023 - 22 = 2001

   PROTIP: Write it down for account recovery, such as in a 1Password entry.
   Also write down the date you created the account in a calendar entry when you'll switch accounts.

3. You'll need a phone number for multi-factor Authentication.

   PROTIP: Microsoft does not accept VOIP number such as those from Googgle Voice.
   They require a cell number from a cell carrier (Verizon, ATT, etc.).



<a name="GlobalAdmin"></a>

## Global Administrators

<strong>Global Administrators</strong> are aka "Company Administrators" in Entra ID because they have access to <strong>almody all services</strong> that impact AAD/Entra identities (Microsoft 365 security center, Intune, Microsoft 365 compliance center, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Skype for Business Online, etc.).

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ9uQtO7mSU&list=PLWag0-UcFD4HacGTnNVUzUMIsIF1CXySQ&index=2">VIDEO</a> To prevent being locked out of accounts, have no MFA on Global Admin accounts.

1. Set another account for regular work so the Global Admin account is not used regularly. 

1. Set at least two other Global Admin users.

1. Set an activity alert to replace them each when their account is made inactive or deleted (when they leave).

1. Set an activity alert to the SOC and other Global Admins when a Global Admin account is used.

1. Login to the Global Admin account 

   PROTIP: Global Admin privileges are needed to enable <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure">AD PIM (Privileged Identity Management)</a> for a directory.

   <a name="EscalatedPermissions"></a> 

   ### Set User Access Admin permissions

   REMEMBER: Global Admins get access to Azure resources only after being granted User Access Admin role.

   To work with <strong>Management Groups</strong>, in Azure RBAC the Global Administrator assigns him/herself the role "User Access Administrator" which has access to the root scope (/) with access to all Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups in the Tenant:

   <pre>az role assignment list --role "User Access Administrator" --scope "/"
   az rest --method post --url "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess?api-version=2016-07-01"
   az account management-group entities list
   az account management-group list
   </pre>

   Alternately, in the Console GUI:
   
   1. Get to the Entra ID service (formerly Azure Active Directory), Properties:<br /><br />https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Properties

   1. Click the slider "can manage access to all Azure subscriptions and management groups in this tenant" to "Yes".
   1. Save.
   1. Log out and in again.
   1. Get to your Subscription: <br /><br />https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade

   1. Click "Access Control (IAM)", "View my access" to see "User Access Administrator" listed among Role Assignments.
   1. Get to "Management groups"<br /><br />https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ManagementGroups/ManagementGroupBrowseBlade/~/MGBrowse_overview
   
   1. Click "Start using management groups".
   1. In Overview: your entities:

### Security Jobs To Be Done

How the <a target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/SecurityRoles">concerns</a> of each organizational role type/team relate with others, from Plan (Governance) to Build to Run (Operations) stages:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1690410983/azure-security-roles-1883x903_j2yehb.png"><img alt="azure-security-roles-1883x903.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1690410983/azure-security-roles-1883x903_j2yehb.png"><br /><em>Click image for full page</em></a>

PROTIP: Who covers each of these concerns where you work?
Not having an individual/department designated for each responsibility below is often the reason why it doesn't get done and thus creates vulnerabilities not addressed.

   * Board (of corporate directors)
   * Management (Business Model, Vision, Strategies, Objectives, Policies, Budget: Staffing, Tools, Training)

Security Leadership:
   * PMO (Program Management Office)
   * Leadership and Culture
   * Risk Management
   * Policy & Standards

Compliance Management:
   * Privacy & Compliance Requirements
   * Compliance Reporting
   * Technical Policy Monitoring

Security Architecture:
   * Requirements Translation
   * Architecture & Risk Assessments
   * Technical Policy Authoring

Security Posture Management: Monitor & Remediate Risk
   * User Education & Awareness, Insider Risk
   * Dev Education & Awareness, App Security, Data Security
   * Identity & Key Management: Admin. Security, Identity System Security
   * IT Operations: Infra & Endpoint: Deploy tools, Mitigate Vulnerabilities
   * OT (IoT) Operations
   
Security Operations Center (SOC):
   * Incident Preparation: Risk Scenarios, Practice Exercises
   * Incident Management: Incident Response, Threat Hunting

Other Departments:
   * Threat Intelligence

PROTIP: Define abbreviations for each above.


<hr />

<a name="Naming"></a>

### Naming Abbreviations

REMEMBER: <strong>Resource names are limited to 64 characters.</strong>

PROTIP: Abbreviations are needed to keep names short. 
Abbreviations can serve as a way to inform policies, such as locking of production servers.
Define abbreviations in different human languages if you have an international crew.

Based on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming">Microsoft's advice on naming conventions</a>:

Use in this order:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1691185898/az-resc-naming-3254x1322_vxg0ni.png"><img alt="az-resc-naming-3254x1322.png" width="650" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1691185898/az-resc-naming-3254x1322_vxg0ni.png"><br /><em>Click image for full page</em></a>

   1. fin, mktg, prd, it, sec, corp = <strong>Business division: organizational element</strong> that owns the subscription or workload the resource belongs to. 

   1. shared, central, client = <strong>Subscription type</strong> - the purpose of the subscription that contains the resource. 
   
   1. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations">rg, vm, etc. = <strong>Resource type</strong></a> for each Microsoft service. 
   
   1. navigator, emissions, sharepoint, hadoop = <strong>Workload</strong> (Application or service name that the resource is a part of.
   
   1. prd (production), dev, tst, qa1, stg (staging) = <strong>Environment</strong> for each phase in the lifecycle of the workload toward productive use. [<a href="#EnvDifferences">Differences</a>]
   
   1. westus, eastus2, westeu = <strong>Region</strong> - The Azure region where the resource is deployed. <a href="#PickRegions">Pick a  region</a>

   1. 001, 002, etc. <strong>Instance</strong> - A number or other identifier that distinguishes the resource from other resources of the same type in the same <a href="#ResourceGroups">resource group</a> and region.

   * Additional fields are geographies: city, country, state, etc.

Example conventions used within <a href="#Bicep">Bicep</a>, and other IoC:

   <pre>var vnetName= 'vnet-${env}-${region}-${instance}'
var subnetName = 'subnet-${env}-${region}-${instance}'
   </pre>

From <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-first-bicep-template/5-add-flexibility-parameters-variables?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004750&source=learn">LEARN</a>: <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-first-bicep-template/6-exercise-add-parameters-variables-bicep-template?pivots=powershell">SANDBOX</a>:
In the main.bicep file:

   <pre>@allowed([
  'nonprod'
  'prod'
])
param environmentType string
&nbsp;
# Using ternary operator to express some if/then/else logic:
var storageAccountSkuName = (environmentType == 'prod') ? 'Standard_GRS' : 'Standard_LRS'
var appServicePlanSkuName = (environmentType == 'prod') ? 'P2V3' : 'F1'
   </pre>

PROTIP: Stable names make for less rework and mistakes with <strong>Dynamic group membership rules</strong> used to automatically assign permissions to resources. Example:

   <ul><pre>(user.department -eq "it") and (user.city -eq "Manhattan") and (resource.type -eq "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines")</pre></ul>

<a name="Assumptions"></a>

### Mindsets and Assumptions (Awareness)

PROTIP: Many don't take security "seriously" because they haven't fully grasped these realities: <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/ten-laws-of-security#10-laws-of-cybersecurity-risk">"Laws of Cybersecurity Risk"</a> and Security:

1. <strong>Security success is ruining the attacker ROI</strong> - Security can’t achieve an absolutely secure state so deter them by disrupting and degrading their Return on Investment (ROI). Increase the attacker’s cost and decrease the attacker’s return for your most important assets.

2. <strong>Not keeping up is falling behind</strong> – Security is a continuous journey, you must keep moving forward because it will continually get cheaper and cheaper for attackers to successfully take control of your assets. You must continually update your security patches, security strategies, threat awareness, inventory, security tooling, security hygiene, security monitoring, permission models, platform coverage, and anything else that changes over time.
   * An out-of-date antimalware scanner is only marginally better than no scanner at all.
   <br /><br />

3. <strong>Productivity always wins</strong> – If security isn’t easy for users, they'll work around it to get their job done. Always make sure solutions are secure and usable.

4. <strong>Attackers don't care</strong> - Attackers will use any available method to get into your environment and increase access to your assets, including compromising a networked printer, a fish tank thermometer, a cloud service, a PC, a Server, a Mac, a mobile device, influence or trick a user, exploit a configuration mistake or insecure operational process, or just ask for passwords in a phishing email. Your job is to understand and take away the easiest and cheapest options as well as the most useful ones (for example, anything that leads to administrative privileges across many systems).

5. <strong>Ruthless Prioritization is a survival skill</strong> – Nobody has enough time and resources to eliminate all risks to all resources. Always start with what is most important to your organization, most interesting to attackers, and continuously update this prioritization.

6. <strong>Cybersecurity is a team sport</strong> – Nobody can do it all, so always focus on the things that only you (or your organization) can do to protect your organization's mission. For things that others can do better or cheaper, have them do it (security vendors, cloud providers, community).

7. <strong>Your network isn’t as trustworthy as you think it is</strong> - A security strategy that relies on passwords and trusting any intranet device is only marginally better than no security strategy at all. Attackers easily evade these defenses so the trust level of each device, user, and application must be proven and validated continuously starting with a level of <strong>Zero Trust</strong>.
   * If a bad actor has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.
   * If a bad actor can persuade you to run their program on your computer, it's not solely your computer anymore.
   * If a bad actor can alter the operating system on your computer, it's not your computer anymore.
   * If you allow a bad actor to run active content in your website, it's not your website anymore.
   <br /><br />

8. <strong>Isolated networks aren’t automatically secure</strong> - While air-gapped networks can offer strong security when maintained correctly, successful examples are extremely rare because each node must be completely isolated from outside risk. If security is critical enough to place resources on an isolated network, you should invest in mitigations to address potential connectivity via methods such as USB media (for example, required for patches), bridges to intranet network, and external devices (for example, vendor laptops on a production line), and insider threats that could circumvent all technical controls.
   * Absolute anonymity isn't practically achievable, online or offline.
   <br /><br />

9. <strong>Encryption alone isn’t a data protection solution</strong> - Encryption protects against out of band attacks (on network packets, files, storage, etc.), but data is only as secure as the decryption key (key strength + protections from theft/copying) and other authorized means of access.
   * Encrypted data is only as secure as its decryption key.
   * Weak passwords trump strong security.
   <br /><br />

11. <strong>Technology doesn't solve people and process problems</strong> - While machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other technologies offer amazing leaps forward in security (when applied correctly), cybersecurity is a human challenge and will never be solved by technology alone.
   * Technology isn't a panacea.
   * A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy.

### What Does Security Want?

NOTE: Many land on this as part of their organization's effort to transition to make use of the public cloud.


Major <strong>Objectives</strong> (What, Why, Who, How activities):

1. People: Educate teams about the cloud security journey
2. People: Educate teams on cloud security technology

3. Process: Assign accountability for cloud security decisions
4. Process: Update incident response processes for cloud
5. Process: Establish security posture management

6. Technology: Require passwordless or multifactor authentication
7. Technology: Integrate native firewall and network security
8. Technology: Integrate native threat detection

9. Architecture: Standardize on a single directory and identity
11. Architecture: Use identity-based access control instead of keys
11. Architecture: Establish a single unified security strategy
<br /><br />

There is also "Zero Trust" (aka.ms/zerotrust, aka.ms/ztbizplan, aka.ms/ztguide)
   * <strong>Verify identity</strong>, location, context explicitly (detect anomalies)
   * Use <strong>least-privilege</strong> (JIT, Just Enough) access with adaptive policies
   * <strong>Assume breach</strong> (segment access, encrypt, alert variation posture)
   <br /><br />


### Out-sourcing

Not a lot of people <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2903436/make-sense-of-cloud-service-brokers.html">talk about this</a>, but a Cloud Management Platform (CMP) from a CSB (Cloud Service Broker such as AppDirect, Ensim, Gravitant, Jamcracker, Parallels, Ostrato, ServiceNow, BMC, etc.) is used by enterprises to provide provisioning governance, self-service, usage chargeback, and policy enforcement across multiple cloud vendors. 


<a name="MCSB"></a>

### Security Baselines

A <strong>security baseline</strong> is a snapshot in time of a system's current configuration (defining specific OS-level settings, installed apps, app configurations, users, etc.). Baselines are created as the basis for determining what settings were changed (and when).


<a name="SecControls"></a>

### Azure Security Benchmarks (ASB)

DEFINITION: A <strong>benchmark</strong> is an individual check (evaluation) of a system's setting, such as the patch level of an application installed, to determine whether best practices (security controls) are employed (which in turn should reduce the attack surface of the system).

Several organizations have defined for the industry specific <strong>"controls"</strong> (<strong>improvement actions</strong>):
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks">CIS (Center for Internet Security) Controls v8 Benchmarks</a>
   * NIST SP 800-53 RC4
   * PCI-DSS v3.2.1
   <br /><br />

With the aim of improving the security of cloud-centric workloads, data, and services on Azure, perhaps in multi-cloud environments, in <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/overview">2021</a> Microsoft published its prescriptive best-practice framework in its MCSB (<strong>Microsoft Cybersecurity Security Benchmarks</strong>). <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Security%20Benchmark/3.0">Version 3 as of March 30, 2023 is here as the  azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet file for</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/raw/master/Azure%20Security%20Benchmark/3.0/azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx">download</a>.

### In Dev vs Prod

In Prod, Key Vault secrets are locked from deletion for 90 days.<br />
In Dev, Key Vault values can be deleted at the discretion of developers.<br />

In Dev, devs can access the Azure Portal interactively to create resources during CI/CD IaC pipeline construction.<br />
In Prod, resources are deployed only by CI/CD pipelines and devs cannot access the Azure Portal interactively.<br />

Devs are limited by policies to a limit of two regions to avoid runaway costs.<br />
Prod configurations usually cover several regions for redundancy and performance to end-customers.

### Azure Government environments

Microsoft runs separate/isolated <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/government/">Azure fed/state/local gov</a> "sovereign DoD Level 5" cloud hardware on US soil operated by US citizens. 

1. Specify the target cloud environment:

   <pre><strong>az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment</strong></pre>

   AzureUSGovernment has its own Marketplace of apps.

1. Know that <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure">each service has different host names</a> for US government work. For example, Speech Studio Speech translation has these API endpoints:
   * Virginia: https://usgovvirginia.s2s.speech.azure.us
   * Arizona: https://usgovarizona.s2s.speech.azure.us
   <br /><br />

## Subscriptions

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAC0IIYSJM&list=PLWag0-UcFD4HacGTnNVUzUMIsIF1CXySQ&index=17">VIDEO KnowOps</a>
   <br /><br />

At the <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade">Subscription pane</a>

A <strong>Subscription</strong> is a billing boundary linked to an Azure account
   AND A container for resource groups.

There can be multiple Subscriptions per tenant (e.g. for depts.).
   * Non-prod (for devs)
   * Production (for operations)
   * Multi-region
   <br /><br />

   Multiple subscriptions can be created under a single Azure account (Dev, Test, Staging, Production, Logging,  Demo, Training, DR, etc.). This is particularly useful for businesses because:

   DEFINITION: A Subscription is your "bank account" / credit card.

   PROTIP: access control and billing occur at the subscription level, not the account level.

   PROTIP: Each Subscription can only trust a single AAD/Entra directory.

   Transfer ownership of a subscription, such as to a central accounting department.

   Add additional subscriptions when you may exceed limits within a subscription: # VNets.

REMEMBER: The 2000 role assignments limit per subscription is fixed and cannot be increased.

Subscription types:
   * Azure pass (e.g. with a course)
   * MSDN (Developer Network)
   * Azure trial
   * Pay-as-you-go (most common)
   * Enterprise (involves a minimum commitment)

## Phase 15. Devices - MS Authenticator app

* User-owned BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) or Org-owned Windows or mobile devices are "Registered" to Azure AD (not joined) to access cloud resources (not on-prem).
* Organisations with on-premises AD <strong>join</strong> org-owned Windows 10 (not Home) devices using Azure AD Connect. If worker is remote, set Group Policy or other AD requirements.
* "Hybrid Join" Windows 10 and down-level (8.1, 7)
<br /><br />

7. Install the <strong>Microsoft Authenticator app</strong> on you smartphone and setup Two-factor authentication to approve access using your phone.

8. Get a unique profile image and <a target="_blank" href="https://account.microsoft.com/profile/edit-picture?fref=home.banner.profile">add picture</a>.

<a name="PickRegions"></a>

### Phase 01. Pick Region(s)

1. PROTIP: You'll be soon asked to specify a region. Pick the region closest to you.

   By combining several sources, I compiled <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1diCL35orX9cVEgti1eU7aaG_sgyDSPmbQjnXBamUnVc/edit?usp=sharing">this private Google Sheet</a> of 53 regions:

   * _Theater : a custom grouping (APJ, AMER, EMEA)
   * _Geography : Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, China, Europe, Middle East, South America, US
   * _RegionName : the name of the region (e.g. "East US")
   * _Sovereignty : the country where the region is located (e.g. "United States")
   * _PhysicalLocation : the city where the region is located (e.g. "Chicago")
   * _Latitude : where 0 is the equator (e.g. "41.881832")
   * _Longitude : where 0 is the Prime Meridian (GMT) near London
   * _AvailZones : if supported, the number of availability zones in the region (e.g. "3")
   * _PairedRegion : the name of the paired region (e.g. "West US")
   * _RestrictionStatus : "Enabled by default" or "Access Restricted"
   <br /><br />   

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cli/azure/account#az_account_list_locations">This command</a> lists all 83 Azure regions, which includes some not available for customer use.

   <pre>az account list-locations | wc -l</pre>

   <pre>  {
    "displayName": "Brazil Southeast",
    "id": "/subscriptions/7a0bbbfc-a36d-4d73-bbaf-e381b82397c6/locations/brazilsoutheast",
    "metadata": {
      "geography": "Brazil",
      "geographyGroup": "South America",
      "latitude": "-22.90278",
      "longitude": "-43.2075",
      "pairedRegion": [
        {
          "id": "/subscriptions/7a0bbbfc-a36d-4d73-bbaf-e381b82397c6/locations/brazilsouth",
          "name": "brazilsouth"
        }
      ],
      "physicalLocation": "Rio",
      "regionCategory": "Other",
      "regionType": "Physical"
    },
    "name": "brazilsoutheast",
    "regionalDisplayName": "(South America) Brazil Southeast",
    "type": "Region"
  }
   </pre>

1. CAUTION: This command lists only 83 Azure regions with no Latitude and Longitude, data all mixed up:

   <pre>az account list-locations --output tsv >locations.csv</pre>


1. Select a Geograph (country), then a Region from Microsoft's list at:

   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies

   At time of writing, Microsoft has over 60 regions around the world on <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/">their map</a>:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/109421738-cfe65980-7995-11eb-9a04-1b385f2ed631.png"><img alt="az-map-2021-1440x741.png" width="1440" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/109421738-cfe65980-7995-11eb-9a04-1b385f2ed631.png"><br /><em>Click image for full page</em></a>

1. There is also an <a target="_blank" href="https://build5nines.com/map-azure-regions/">
interactive map showing a point for each region's Longitude and Latitude</a> with city name.
   
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.azurespeed.com/">http://www.<strong>azurespeed.com</strong></a> measures current ping speeds between regions on Microsoft's Azure cloud. To stop collection, click "uncheck all" or individual regions of interest:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://build5nines.com/map-azure-regions/"><img alt="cloud-service-azure-checks-603x261-56530" width="603" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40890517-a7bc4b02-6734-11e8-9c1f-88e6a686de0d.jpg">https://build5nines.com/map-azure-regions/</a>

1. There are differences in cost between regions. For example, the US East region is cheaper than the US West region.

1. To display Microsoft's own analysis of <strong>ping speeds between its regions</strong> (using data from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thousandeyes.com/">thousandeyes.com</a> (Cisco) network analytics company, view:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/azure-network-latency">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/azure-network-latency<br /><br /><img alt="azure-network-latency-2020-12-2761x1756.png" width="2761" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/109372837-e773f400-7868-11eb-8804-1d306f22fba2.png"></a>

   PROTIP: In the above, the slowest is 400 ms round-trip between Cape Town (South Africa West) and Australia East.

   NOTE: One big advantage of Azure over AWS is that AWS requires users to do their own backups and restores.
   But Microsoft does its own complete backups of all data in each zone, and when there is an outage, they take care of restoring it to a new zone. Where backups go is not public information, but it is likely that they are in a different zone in the same region, or in a different region. 

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions">These cross-region pairs</a> are used for replication in Azure business continuity and disaster recovery. For example:

   <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
   <tr><th> Geography </th><th> Region pair A </th><th> Region Pair B </th></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> North America	</td><td> East US<td></td> West US </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> North America	</td><td> East US 2<td></td> Central US </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> North America	</td><td> North Central US<td></td> South Central US </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> North America	</td><td> West US 2<td></td> West Central US </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> North America	</td><td> West US 3<td></td> East US </td></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td> Europe </td><td> North Europe (Ireland)<td></td> West Europe (Netherlands) </td></tr>
   </table>
   <br /><br />

   NOTE: The Microsoft Frontdoor service enables you to use a single global IP address for your application. 
   Microsoft automatically routes traffic to the region closest to the user. This is similar to AWS CloudFront.

<a name="Naming"></a>

### Resource Naming conventions

PROTIP: Decide on naming conventions and abbreviations BEFORE you create any resources.
Abbreviations are needed to keep names short.
This is both to avoid re-dos and to help with less stressful collaboration and communication,
especially if you have an international crew with different human languages and cultures.

PROTIP: Some abbreviations can inform policies, such as locking of production servers.

Based on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming">Advice from Microsoft about naming conventions</a>:

   * shared, central, client = <strong>Subscription type</strong> - the purpose of the subscription that contains the resource. 

   * fin, mktg, product, it, corp = <strong>Business unit</strong> - organizational element that owns the subscription or workload the resource belongs to. 

   * westus, eastus2, westeu = <strong>Location/Region</strong> - The Azure region where the resource is deployed.

   * prod, dev, qa, stage, test = <strong>Deployment environment</strong> - The stage of the development lifecycle for the workload that the resource supports.

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations">rg, vm</a> = <strong>Resource asset type</strong>. 

   * navigator, emissions, sharepoint, hadoop = <strong>name of the application, workload, or service</strong> that the resource is a part of.

PROTIP: Keep the sequence of the abbreviations consistent, so that you can easily find the resource in the portal.

## My Azure-quickly repo on GitHub

My repo <a target="_blank" href=" 
https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly">
https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly</a>
contains automation scripts to invoke instead of manually operating the Azure Portal, so that you can save money by deleting Resource Groups because you can get resources back with just a few commands. 

Automation also enables you to stand up resources in different regions/locations the same way. 

Most scripts in the repo are Bash shell scripts that run natively on MacOS and thus familiar to most developers. 
PowerShell scripts are used in cases where they are the only solution, are more efficient, or covered in a tutorial.

Utility script code enable the scripts to run from Linux and Git Shell on Windows laptops. 

The scripts are also useful for learning Azure.

### Login to az CLI & PowerShell

   * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest#az_login
   * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively
   * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli
   * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli#change-the-active-tenant
   <br /><br />

1. Open a Terminal. 
1. The command to login to Azure is:

   <pre><strong>az login</strong></pre>

1. In the browser window that opens, select the email account you want to use. Successful login would result in a list of subscriptions you have access to, such as:

   <pre>...
    "name": "Azure Subscription 1",
    "tenantId": "11111234-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddeeefff111",
    ...
    "name": "Pay-As-You-Go",
    "tenantId": "22221234-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddeeefff111",
    ...
    "name": "Twilio SendGrid",
    "tenantId": "33331234-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddeeefff111",
    ...
   </pre>

   Enterprise admins are likely to have multiple Azure accounts, so highlight and copy the tenant you want:

1. PROTIP: Define in ~/mac-setup.env secrets file the tenents so that you can specify which one to use each time.

   The resulting login command would be like:

   <pre><strong>az login --tenant 11111234-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddeeefff111</strong></pre>

   Alternately, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively
   <pre>read -sp "Azure password: " AZ_PASS && echo && az login -u <username> -p $AZ_PASS</pre>

1. Close the browser window or read resources about AZ CLI from a Terminal:

   * https://ss64.com/ps/ (A-Z index of PowerShell commands)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2aIVYxim-A&t=2m56m&list=PLWag0-UcFD4HacGTnNVUzUMIsIF1CXySQ&index=6" title="Forced to learn a new shell and vi editor by Dana Epps Oct 3, 2019">VIDEO</a>: Cloud Shell
   <br /><br />

   REMEMBER: Each Azure account has a 5GB storage held in your file share.

1. Create a folder, substituting your own project name:

   <pre>mkdir proj1; cd proj1
   </pre>

1. Download

   <pre><strong>git clone http://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup;cd mac-setup;chmod +x az-info.sh
   </strong></pre>

1. Set permissions:

   <pre><strong>chmod +x az-info.sh
   </strong></pre>

1. To avoid <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16853624/git-discovery-across-filesystem-not-set">error</a> "Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set)."

   <pre><strong>export GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM=1
   git remote add origin https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup
   git fetch
   git pull origin master
   </strong></pre>

1. Change permissions to enable execution by the specific script:

   <pre><strong>chmod +x az-info.sh
   </strong></pre>

   CAUTION: Avoid granting permissions for all scripts in a folder to limit "blast radius".

1. Run the script file from GitHub:
   
   <pre>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup/master/az-info.sh)"
   </pre>

   That script is similar to the aws-info.sh script in my <a target="_blank" href="">aws-quickly</a> repo.

   TODO: I'm also working on a PowerShell version of the script.

1. Install modules needed, Per https://wilsonmar.github.io/powershell-install-coding

   <pre><strong>pwsh; Install-Module azuread</strong></pre>

   <pre>Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy value by running the 
Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
   </pre>

   PROTIP: Azure CLI commands can be issued from within PowerShell (.ps1) script files. 
   See ListUserAndPermissions.ps1 

Here I list both CLI and PowerShell commands to get information:
   * List Azure accounts, groups membership, role permissions
   * List resources
   * List storage accounts
   * List compute instances
   * List databases
   * etc.
   <br /><br />

### Azure Blueprints

As of September 23, 2023, Azure has stopped development of its "Blueprints" which maintain versions of the relationship between what should be deployed and what was actually deployed. So it supports auditing of deployments over time. And, on its own, a Blueprint can be applied to several subscriptions at once. [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rSCnAZPNfo">VIDEO</a>] Also, Azure Blueprints are stored in Azure Cosmos cloud DB, which is replicated globally to several regions for ultimate reliability. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/azure-blueprints-shelved">NEWS</a>: Microsoft announced that it is retiring Azure Blueprints on Sep 30, 2024. Microsoft recommends that customers use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) <strong>template specs</strong> and <strong>deployment stacks</strong> to manage their environments.

Notice in sample Blueprints files that it's in JSON format:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timothywarner/az500/tree/main/scripts/blueprints/basic-networking-blueprint">basic networking</a>

Blueprints orchestrate deployment of resources/artifacts as policy.

In the <strong>Artifacts</strong> folder, Blueprints <a target="_blank" href="https://itnext.io/iac-azure-blueprints-and-terraform-7349ecf8d61c">has these</a>:

   * Role assignments
   * Policy assignments
   * ARM templates
   * Resource groups
   <br /><br />

Template Specs will be taking over for Blueprints?

   * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/177308/index.html

Blueprints the only mechanism for assigning deny permissions to Resource Groups.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/177308/index.html

HashiCorp's Terraform, which completely controls and maintains changes.

   * https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm

<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/azure-security-benchmark-foundation/">This sample Blueprint</a> deploys several Azure services to provide a secure, monitored, enterprise-ready foundation:<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1690479433/azure-subscription-arch-1154x999_us8vps.png"><img alt="azure-subscription-arch-1154x999.png" width="1154" height="999" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1690479433/azure-subscription-arch-1154x999_us8vps.png"></a>

An important design of Azure Blueprints within enterprises is that it allows for <strong>separation of duties</strong> between technical teams responsible for creating and maintaining the blueprint and those (in Operations) responsible for deploying it. This is similar to the separation of duties between developers and operations in DevOps favored for compliance. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://myrestraining.com/blog/azure/azure-blueprints-terraform/">This</a>
presents the analysis that Azure Blueprints is a top-down approach to infrastructure management, while Terraform is a bottom-up approach.

## IaC Stacks

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/stack?view=azure-cli-latest
A deployment stack is a native Azure resource type that enables you to perform operations on a resource collection as an atomic unit.

Deployment stacks are defined in ARM as the type Microsoft.Resources/deploymentStacks.

</table>


<hr />

<a name="AD"></a>

### AD = Active Directory 

Active Directory stores credentials for (older)
run on Windows servers in on-prem data centers.
This older <strong>on-prem</strong> AD provides "domain services" that include domain joins, group policies, LDAP, Kerberos / NTLM authentication. 
It uses the AD Admin Center GUI.


<a name="AAD"></a>

### Entra = AAD = Azure Active Directory

Entra/Azure Active Directory (AAD) registers Users and Groups, plus apps and devices. 
AAD/Entra is a SaaS service, unlike "Active Directory" running on Windows servers in on-prem data centers. 
So AAD/Entra is also called an "Identity as a Service" (IDaaS). 

   * Since Azure Microsoft Office 365 is SaaS, users are enrolled into AAD/Entra.

   * Because it's SaSS, it’s also possible to use AAD/Entra for Federation SSO (Single Sign On) to manage third-party software applications (outside Microsoft), such as CRMs like Salesforce, SAP, Concur, etc.


<a name="AAD-Connect"></a>

### AAD/Entra Connect

<strong>Entra Connect</strong> is a Windows service that synchronizes on-prem AD user metadata with the SaaS AAD. Key features of AAD Connect:
   * Password hash sych with AAD/Entra
   * Pass-through authentication which allows users to use the same password on-prem. and in the cloud.
   * Federation integration with AD FS for certificate renewal
   * Synchronization to ensure on-prem and cloud data matches
   * Health monitoring in a central location
   <br /><br />

### AD App Proxy instead of VPN

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqsqTttYJVY&list=PLtVMyW0H7aiOQwZSsn2d-tg2z729ce1BZ&index=7">VIDEO</a>:
Traditional VPN enable users to access all ports on the entire network.

Apps configured to use AD App Proxy would limit user access to only the app configured,
using what's called "explicit user and device trust validation".


<a name="Domains"></a>

### Tenant Domains 

DEFINITION: A domain is an area of a network organized by a <strong>single authentication database</strong>.

DEFINITION: An "Active Directory Domain" is a logical grouping of AD objects on a network.

DEFINITION: An Active Directory Domain Controller (DC) is a (Windows) server that authenticates user identities and authorizes their access to resources.

An Azure Domain is not the same as a domain (DNS) web host names. 

At <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#settings/directory">https://portal.azure.com/#settings/directory</a>,
the "Domain" text is a combination of the root account email address text in front of ".onmicrosoft.com". For example, <tt>johndoe@whatever.com</tt> becomes Domain <tt>johndoewhatever.onmicrosoft.com</tt> (without the TLD such as ".com").


<a name="PortalSearch"></a>

### Portal Search AAD/Entra

1.  <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com">portal.azure.com</a>

2.  Press G and / to position the cursor to the Search field at the top.

    <a name="AAD"></a>

3.  Type <strong>Entra</strong> for the Services related to that name.

4.  Click for the blade called <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview">Entra ID</a> .

    https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview


    <a name="Tenants"></a>

    ### Tenants in Entra ID

5.  Highlight and copy the value of the Name field, such as "<em>something</em>.onmicrosoft.com".

6.  Notice the "Tenant ID" GUID below it.

7.  Open another browser tab (temporarily) to find the Tenant ID based on DNS host/domain (web host) name such as "contoso.com" or "something.onmicrosoft.com":

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whatismytenantid.com/">https://www.whatismytenantid.com</a>

8.  Paste the name and click "Find my tenant ID" to see the "Directory ID" (GUID), for example:

    <tt>6babcaad-1234-5678-789a-9fd97c0b779f</tt>

9.  Click "Copy to clipboard".
11. Remember the last few characters of the GUID returned.
11. Switch back to the browser Portal tab.


    <a name="TenantSwitch"></a>

    ### Tenant Switching

1.  To switch among tenants in the Portal GUI, use the "Directory + subscription" filter at the top menu of every screen:

    <img alt="az-onramp-subscrip-462x263" width="462" height="263" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/112444406-9cd48300-8d13-11eb-9aac-24feb64af66a.png">

    Within PowerShell, define the default Tenant (if you need to sign into more than one Tenant):

    <pre><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/servicemanagement/azurerm.profile/set-azurermcontext?view=azuresmps-4.0.0">Set-AzureRmContext</a>
    </strong></pre>


    ### Tenant = Directory

11. Click the icon at the top bar that looks like a notebook with a funnel.

    https://portal.azure.com/#settings/directory

    Notice the Directory ID GUID is the same as the Tenant ID GUID.

    DEFINITION: A Directory (as in AAD/Entra) is where your Tenant metadata is stored.

    Everything you do in Azure must be under some Tenant.

    Each tenant is independent of all other tenants.

    A tenant represents an organization in AAD/Entra.
   
    
    ### Users, Groups, Apps

    At the right is a count of Users, Groups, Applications, and Devices managed under that Tenant.

    ### Federation

    <a name="EntApps"></a>

    Microsoft has created integrations with Enterprise SaaS applications such as 
    Dropbox, Google Docs, AWS, Salesforce, SAP, Concur, etc.

    "<strong>External Identity</strong>" are Guest users with a credential federated from another Identity Store (Facebook, Google Gmail, GitHub, etc.) or a new SAML/WS-Fed IdP.

    After an IdP is defined, define User flows (see AD B2C).

    (from Tim Warner)
    <img alt="az-aad-groups-751x987.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1674201184/az-aad-groups-751x987_fasfn0.jpg">

    
    "<strong>Managed Identities</strong>" are also called "Service Accounts" used for authenticating automation services. Such accounts are assigned a GUID instead of email addresses for human users.

    ### Invitation from Federation

    (from Tim Warner)
    <img alt="az-federation-1950x1716.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1674268604/az-federation-1950x1716_nh17eb.jpg">

    There are two types of Consent to Entra ID:
    a) Federation<br />
    b) Non-federated MSA (Microsoft Account from Skype, XBox)

    DEFINITION: OTP (One-Time Password) is emailed to the user.


    <a name="CreateGroup"></a>
    
    ### Create New Group

    Groups make authorization easier.

    Groups can be nested under another Group.
    
12. Select "All Groups".
13. Select "New Group".
    
    Membership type "Assigned" are <strong>manually</strong> selected into each group.

    Membership type "Dynamic" Users and Devices are completely (automatically) controlled by Azure AD, which populates membership based on user/device <strong>properties</strong>.

    There are custom extension properties. 
    Selecting Property: city Operator: Equals Value: Tampa yields Rule syntax:

    <pre>(user.city -eq "Tampa")</pre>

14. Click "Create".

    Alternately, Powershell commands to create a group: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6WZejkXAa4">VIDEO</a>

    <pre>Create-AzureADGroup -DisplayName "Tampa Users" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "TampaUsers" -Description "Users in Tampa"</pre>

    License "Entra ID Premium P2" for production enterprises. P2 provides "Identity Protection" and "Identity Governance" features. P2 is needed for MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and PIM.


    <a name="PIM"></a>

    ### P2 PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

    For those with a P2 license, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure">Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM)</a> provides elevated access on a <strong>JIT (Just-in-Time)</strong> basis for a limited time. access. PIM provides audit logs to enable reviews of accesses. 

    Email is automatically sent when a role assignmnet is made outside of PIM. So do all access changes from the PIM UI, using "Privileged Authentication/Role Administrator" role assignments. Assignment can be permanent or based on time and date range.

1. REMEMBER: PIM must be enabled by the <a href="#AdminUsers">Global Admin</a> after MFA sign-on.

1.  Users search for PIM, Azure resources, to see <strong>assignments</strong> to <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-activate-role?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support">activate yourself</a>:

REMEMBER: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PbGbTUSAg&t=1h26m26s">VIDEO</a>: There is no spanning between AAD/Entra and AD RBAC roles:

<img width="1920" height="534" alt="az-roles-vs-aad-roles-1920x534" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/118071390-e7ae6680-b364-11eb-8e73-673e3f5d593e.png">

<a name="Built-inRoles"></a>

## Built-in User Roles for RBAC 

   PowerShell command lists 75 user roles:<br />
   <tt>Get-AzureRMRoleDefinition</tt> 

   * Application Administrators can create and manage all aspects of <a href="#EntApps">enterprise applications</a>, application registrations, and application proxy settings.

   * Application Developers can create application registrations when the “Users can register applications” setting is set to No.

   * Authentication Administrators can set or reset non-password credentials for some users and can update passwords for all users.

   * Azure DevOps Administrators can manage the Azure DevOps policy to restrict new Azure DevOps organization creation to a set of configurable users or groups.

   * Azure Information Protection Administrators have all permissions in the Azure Information Protection service.

   * B2C User Flow Administrators can create and manage B2C User Flows (also called “built-in” policies) in the Azure portal.

   * B2C User Flow Attribute Administrators can add or delete custom attributes available to all user flows in the tenant.

   * B2C IEF Keyset Administrators can create and manage policy keys and secrets for token encryption, token signatures, and claim encryption/decryption.

   * B2C IEF Policy Administrators can create, read, update, and delete all custom policies in Entra ID B2C and therefore have full control over the Identity Experience Framework in the relevant Entra ID B2C tenant.

   * Billing Administrators can makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.

   * Cloud Application Administrators have the same permissions as the Application Administrator role, excluding the ability to manage application proxy.

   * Cloud Device Administrators can enable, disable, and delete devices in Entra IAD and read Windows 10 BitLocker keys (if present) in the Azure portal.

   * Compliance Administrators have permissions to manage compliance-related features in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, Azure, and Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Center.

   * Compliance Data Administrators have permissions to track data in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, and Azure. Users can also track compliance data within the Exchange admin center,

   * Conditional Access Administrators have the ability to manage Entra ID Conditional Access settings

   * Exchange Administrators have global permissions within Microsoft Exchange Online, when the service is present.

   * Directory Readers can read basic directory information.

   * Groups Administrators can create/manage groups and its settings like naming and expiration policies.

   * Security Administrators have permissions to manage security-related features in the Microsoft 365 security center, Entra Identity Protection, Azure Information Protection, and Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Center.

   BTW, after you follow instructions below on setting up CLI, this Bash command lists all the pre-defined roles:

   <pre><strong>az role definition list -o table --query [].roleName</strong></pre>

   For a count (260 at time of writing):

   <pre><strong>az role definition list --query [].roleName | wc -l</strong></pre>

   The basic categories of roles are <strong>owner, contributor, and reader</strong>:
   * Owners have full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others.
   * Contributors can create and manage all types of Azure resources but can't grant access to others.
   * Readers can view existing Azure resources.
   <br /><br />

<a name="CustomRoles"></a>

### Custom Roles

   Examples of Custom-defined roles are:
   * Reader Support Tickets
   * Virtual Machine operator - can create and manage virtual machines
   <br /><br />

   Let's look at a custom role definition to clarify the terms:
 
   <pre>{
   "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)",
   "Id": null,
   "IsCustom": true,
   "Description": "Allows to start and stop (deallocate) Azure VMs",
   "Actions": [

   Role definitions are at the center of this diagram about RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115958824-50bd5f80-a4c6-11eb-83f8-0cc8e86ca1f2.png"><img alt="az-rbac-524x574" width="524" height="574" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115958824-50bd5f80-a4c6-11eb-83f8-0cc8e86ca1f2.png"></a>

   REMEMBER: There are four ways to assign resource rights to a user:
   * Direct assignment of user to resources.
   * Group assignment - all AAD/Entra group members access rights through user association with a group
   * Rule-based assignment - when a resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource, attaching a role definition to a user, group, <a href="#SvcPrin">service principal</a>, or managed identity at a particular scope.
   * External authority assignment - such as on-prem. directory of SaaS app.
   <br /><br />

   <a name="SvcPrin"></a>
   
   DEFINITION: Each Service Principal can request an Entra ID token to access Azure resources and assign users and groups.

   <a name="RoleAssignment"></a>

### Role Assignment 

   Access is granted by creating a role assignment.<br />
   Access is revoked by removing a role assignment.

### Resource Providers, Actions, Operations, Permissions, Scopes, Groups, Policies

<a name="Providers"></a>

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers

   "Microsoft.KeyVault", "Microsoft.Compute", etc. are <strong>providers</strong> 
   which provide the programming to respond or block APIs requesting some functionality.

   <a name="Actions"></a>
   <a name="Permissions"></a>

   Each line under Actions defines a set of <strong>Permissions</strong> permitted.
   Each line under NotActions defines what is denied. 

   <a name="Operations"></a>

   <strong>Operations</strong> (such as read, write, delete, etc.) are carried out by providers.


   PowerShell to process the <a href="#CustomRoles">custom role definition JSON (above)</a>:

   <pre>wget https://...json
   // Get the Subscription ID associated with the current user context:
   $subscription_id = (Get-AzContext).Subscription.id
   // Replace SUBSCRIPTION_ID within JSON file:
   (Get-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition.json) -Replace 'SUBSCRIPTION_ID', $subscription_id |
     Set-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition.json
   // Grant assess by creting a role assignment:
   New-AzRoleDefinition -InputFile ./customRoleDefinition.json
   // Confirm:
   Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name 'Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)'
   </pre>


<a name="Scopes"></a>

## PHASE 21. Scopes

   The "AssignableScope" in the JSON is illustrated at the lower-right of the diagram.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.cloudskills.io/products/azure-administrator-az-104-exam-prep-course/categories/4743678/posts/8980102">VIDEO</a>:
   After assignment, the SUBSCRIPTION_ID is replaced with the Subscription ID GUID assigned.

   Roles can be <strong>scoped</strong> at several levels (from the Tenant Root Group):

   * Management group (containers) 
   
   * Subscription
   
   * Resource group
   
   * Resource

   Permissions at one level are inherited to child scopes, so<br />
   Permissions are additive: the sum of roles at various levels is what a user can do.

   A user inherits permissions from the <strong>management group</strong> to which the user has been assigned.


### Management Group Policies

<a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=1eac46a5-0934-45d5-9989-0f86dcbac8bc">VIDEO</a>:

1.  Navigate to the "Policy" blade.
2.  Definitions

    In Azure, policies are for evaluating compliance among Resources and their properties, not to control access to resources.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.cloudskills.io/products/azure-administrator-az-104-exam-prep-course/categories/4743678/posts/8980104">VIDEO</a>:
    Policies can be assigned to <strong>scopes</strong> to limit what can be assigned to management levels and change what has been assigned:

    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects">Policy effects</a> include Append, Audit, Deny, Modify, etc. Also: Enforce OPA (Open Policy Agent) Constraint and Enforce Rego Policy.

3.  Select a category from Categories dropdown.

    For example: Require a tag and its value on resources

    See the <a href="#Tags">Tags</a> section above.

    To do remediation, define a Managed Identity.


    <a name="Devices"></a>

    ### Devices on AAD/Entra

    A "Registered" device is personally owned and signed in with a personal Microsoft or local account. It can access mobile and Windows 10 but not Windows Servers.

    A "Joined" device exists only in the cloud to access Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 VMs.

    A "Hybrid" AAD/Entra joined device can access on-prem Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and Server 2008 or newer.

    ### Role Assignments

    REMEMBER: Actions are also called "Operations" at different Scopes.

1.  See "Your role"? (avoid using "Global Admin")

1.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PbGbTUSAg&t=32m23s">VIDEO</a>:
    Click "+ Add" to create a new Tenant.

    PROTIP: Tenant Type "Entra ID" by itself is actually "B2B" = Business to (2) Business. "B2C" means Business to (2) Consumers, or connection to External Identities on LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, etc.

1.  Cancel out by searching for AAD/Entra again.

    Various roles can be can be defined for a tenant - LIMIT: Up to 2,000 roles per individual tenant.

    READ: <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/microsoftazure/how-to-perform-role-assignments-on-azure-resources-from-an-azure-devops-pipeline-c9f4dc10d0a4">Role Assignments on Azure Resources from Azure Pipelines</a>


### ASG (Application Security Groups)

ASGs are wrapped by a NSG (Network Security Group) which route traffic.
   * Admins can RDP.
   * Users cannot RDP.


<hr />

<a name="Resources"></a>

## Resources


<a name="ResourceGroups"></a>

## Phase 10. Resource Groups

Each resource lives in one (and only one) Resource Group.

Each resource must be in a resource group. 
So before provisioning any resource, create a resource group for it to be placed in -- for provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance.


### From ASM to ARM

On July 1, 2019, Microsoft fully transitioned from the "classic" (older) Azure Service Management (ASM) when <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-faq">Multi-factor authentication (through the PhoneFactor Web (PFWeb) portal), API Management, BizTalk, and Managed Cache became available to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

ASM had "Cloud Services" and "Affinity Groups"
which is structured with Resource Groups (logical containers)
providing a single-resource point-of-view [i.e. manage a single resource at a time].

Also, instead of 2 racks on ASM, ARM resources can span 3 racks of computers.



### ARM tokens

<a target="_blank" href="https://portal.cloudskills.io/products/azure-administrator-az-104-exam-prep-course/categories/4743678/posts/8980102#">VIDEO</a>:

1. A user (or service principal) acquires a token for Azure Resource Manager (ARM).  
2. The token includes the user's group memberships (including transitive group memberships).
3. The user makes a REST API call to Azure Resource Manager with the token attached.
4. ARM retrieves all the role assignments and deny assignments that apply to the resource upon which the action is being taken.
5. ARM narrows the role assignments that apply to this user or their group and determines what roles the user ahs for this resource.
6. ARM determines if the action in the API call is included in the roles the user has for this resource.
7. If the user doesn't have a role with the action at the requested scope, access is not granted. Otherwise, ARM checks if ta deny assignment applies.
8. If a deny assignment applies, access is blocked. Otherwise access is granted.

<a name="ARM-CLI"></a>

ARM includes <strong>parallelization</strong> when creating resources for faster deployment of complex, interdependent solutions. 
ARM also includes granular access control, and the ability to tag resources with metadata.

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/111055690-eda3cc00-8435-11eb-9563-aa0fb3154d40.png"><img alt="az-arm-interfaces-599x315.png" width="599" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/111055690-eda3cc00-8435-11eb-9563-aa0fb3154d40.png"></a>

ARM handles Authentication for access to back-end Web App, Data Store, Virtual Machines, etc. 

REMEMBER: The <tt>az deployment</tt> CLI command is used to deploy ARM templates. 

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash
az login
az account set --subscription $subscription-name-or-id
az deployment group create \
    –-subscription $subscription-name-or-id
    --resource-group $resource-group-name
    --template-file $path-to-arm-template.json
</pre>

After this command, pass in the parameters to complete the command. Specify the type of deployment scope using one of four keywords: 
   * group for resource group deployments
   * sub for subscription deployments
   * mg for management group deployments   
   * tenant for tenant deployments
   <br /><br />

Instead, to use PowerShell, use the <tt>New-AzResourceGroupDeployment</tt> cmdlet:

<pre>Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -Subscription "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment 
    -ResourceGroupName $resource-group-name
    -TemplateFile $path-to-template
</pre>

Verify the deployment:

   az deployment group list --output table

<a name="Automation"></a>

## Automation Options to Create Resources

   * <a href="#Portal">Azure portal GUI</a>
   * Azure Bash CLI (az commands)
   * Azure Cloud Shell which enable: Azure PowerShell (Az modules)
   * JSON Templates IaC templates (by custom REST API clients)
   * <a href="#Bicep">Azure Bicep</a>
   * Azure programmatic SDKs using programming languages C# .NET, Java, Python, NodeJs (JavaScript), etc. calling APIs
   * <a href="#Terraform">Terraform</a>
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: A resource group can contain resources from <strong>multiple regions</strong>.
   
   PROTIP: When naming Resource Groups, keep in mind that they are used to organize resources so that're easier to <strong>delete</strong>. So limit the number of resources under each one so that you're not blocked from deleting the group because you still need that one resource. So using Resource Groups for each point in the lifecycle makes sense (dev, qa, stage, green, blue, etc.).

   If no dashes are in the name, double-clicking on that name would select the entire name.

   A Resource Group name can be a single character. It can begin with a number.

   PROTIP: In production, design Resource Groups for work groups to have the permissions they need. For example, core infrastructure such as Networking. The destination of logs and metrics should be viewed and managed using a whole different account than accounts used to create the data.

1. After you get CLI setup, list resource groups created:

   <pre><strong>az group list -o table</strong></pre>

   For more details (SSH, Managed By), remove "-o table".
   See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-groups-azure-cli
   and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli

   A resource cannot be split among several resource groups, each be a member of a single resource group.

<hr />

<a name="CLI_setup"></a>

## Your own cloud shell #

1. PROTIP: Click the <strong>browser profile</strong> icon and select the identity you need (if you have multiple accounts). You'll likely have an account based on your Gmail, another for school email, a work email, etc.

   Azure brings up the account based on what it stored the last time you logged in.
   If you don't use browser profiles, you'll have to log off and back again, which is a hassle.

   BTW within each browser profile, you can login to GitHub, Pocket, or other service so your bookmarks is available on all profiles.

1. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://shell.azure.com/">
   https://shell.azure.com</a>

   ![az-shell-choice-536x232](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115872851-82b7be80-a3ff-11eb-8d7b-012dab3ac544.png)

1. Click "Bash" (since we're using CLI scripts). Or "PowerShell".

   If this is the first time, you'll see "You have no storage mounted":

   ![az-shell-no-starge-550x247](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115875601-9e709400-a402-11eb-9d22-d9d906f3f766.png)

1. PROTIP: Instead of clicking "Create storage" (which will cause Azure to assign its own names), <strong>click "Show advanced settings"</strong> to specify the Resource Group name for your storage account:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115131861-7e7f4180-9fb8-11eb-94f2-bbc1cb3d498b.png"><img width="709" alt="az-onboard-shell-storage-1418x328" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/115131861-7e7f4180-9fb8-11eb-94f2-bbc1cb3d498b.png"></a>

   1. For "Cloud Shell region", select your favorite location, such as "West US".
   1. For "Resource group", follow your naming convention.
   1. For "Storage account", follow your naming convention.
   1. For "File share", follow your File naming convention.
   1. Click "Create storage".
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Files in your CLI <strong>clouddrive</strong> folder is stored in that <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts">Storage account</a>, beginning from CLI history, etc.

1. In <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups">Portal: Resource Groups</a> notice default names created:
   * cloud-shell-storage-westus
   * NetworkWatcherRG
   <br /><br />


   ### az feedback

   PROTIP: If your command doesn't come back, press command+R to reset the browser page.

   Cursor up to retrieve previous commands.

   To open an issue, run: 

   <tt>az feedback</tt>


   ### az interactive

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=YlbFQtUFOY8">VIDEO</a>: 
   There is a nifty code completion facility for az commands: 

   <pre><strong>az interactive</strong></pre>

   ![az-onramp-interactive-1000x537](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/121625006-d920a100-ca2f-11eb-8d7a-acf54906dc0c.png)

1. Press Enter to bypass the "Error loading command module" messages.

1. <tt>az >></tt> is a reminder that within interactive you don't have to type the "az" command, just the sub-command and other parameters.


   ### Home folder commands

1. To see your current folder:

   <pre><strong>pwd</strong></pre>

   If your first name is "wilson" then you'll see:

   <pre>/home/wilson</pre>

1. REMEMBER: The above path is represented by both "~" (tilde) and the variable <tt>$HOME</tt>:

   <pre><strong>cd $HOME; pwd</strong></pre>


   ### CLI Proper Prompt

1. List all files and folders, using to see hidden files as well:

   <pre><strong>ls -al</strong></pre>
   
   <tt>-al</tt> enables display of hidden files such as <tt>.bashrc</tt>

   It's a Linux convention to put a period in front of file names so the operating system knows to treat them as hidden.

1. Copy and paste this string to have the prompt always appear in a consistent place where you have room to type:

   <pre>export PS1="\n  \w\[\033[33m\]\n$ "</pre>

   Let's change it to your taste so it shows up every time you get a Cloud Shell prompt.

   And you will be opening a lot of new sessions.


   ### Time out recovery

   If there is no response in CLI, you probably were timed out (disconnected) automatically.

1. Press Ctrl+R (command+R on a Mac) to refresh, confirm Reload, then click the Cloud Shell again.

   PROTIP: See if the time it takes to do that is about the same as to az login again from your local Terminal/Console.


   ### Edit .bashrc

1. Open the file in a text editor (an instance of Visual Studio Code):

   <pre>code .bashrc</pre>

   Alternately, click the squiggly brackets on the line where you select Bash or PowerShell.

1. Edit the string (near the bottom of the file):

   <pre>PS1=${PS1//\\h/Azure}</pre>

1. PROTIP: Define an alias so you can type just tf instead of <a href="#Terraform">Terraform</a>:

   <pre>alias tf="terraform $1"  # provide a parameter</pre>

1. TODO: There are other aliases for your productivity. They save a few microseconds a time,
   but their advantage is to keep your mind focused, avoid task-switching.

1. Near the last line, navigate into the pre-defined clouddrive folder:

   <pre><strong>cd clouddrive</strong></pre>

   That's where it's better to git clone repos into.

1. PROTIP: At the bottom of the file, add a # sign. This is because Azure automatically adds to the bottom a line:

   <pre>PS1=${PS1//\\h/Azure}</pre>

   Since that line does not add a new line, the line is interpreted as a comment line.

1. To save and quit, press Ctrl+Q or click the "..." at the top right of the edit box.

   Notice there is now a tilde to display the pwd (present working directory):

1. List all files and folders, using to see hidden files as well:

   <pre><strong>ls -al</strong></pre>

   <tt>-al</tt> enables display of hidden file <tt>.bashrc</tt>

   <tt>clouddrive -> /usr/csuser/clouddrive</tt> shows a redirect to another path

1. PROTIP: Notice that clouddrive is a redirect to the physical folder at:

   <pre><strong>ls -al /usr/csuser/clouddrive</strong></pre>



   ### Git clone my Bash CLI scripts

   Several utility programs come pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell.
   Git is one of them.

1. Obtain a copy of my repository containing Bash CLI scripts for use in Azure:

   <pre><strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/azure-quickly
   cd azure-quickly
   </strong></pre>

   NOTE: If you work with a private repo, you'll need to create a SSH key, paste the contents of the public key in GitHub GUI, and use a different command, such as:

   <pre><strong>git clone git-123456@wilsonmar/azure-quickly
   cd azure-quickly
   </strong></pre>

1. To obtain recent changes:

   <pre><strong>git pull
   </strong></pre>

<a name="EncryptedPasswords"></a>

## Encrypted Passwords

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-powershell">DOCS</a>: <a target="_blank" href="https://pascalnaber.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/backdoor-in-azure-devops-to-get-the-password-of-a-service-principal/">BLOG</a>: <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57589379/migrate-local-bash-script-with-azure-cli-commands-to-azure-powershell-task-in-az">SlackOverflow</a>:

PROTIP: It's better to use Azure Key Vault, but this is better than storing cleartext in GitHub.

1. In a PowerShell CLI terminal, manually <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/convertto-securestring?view=powershell-7.1">encrypt a secret under your account</a>:

   <pre>$password = 'Super@Secret3Passwordx'
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText -String $password
   </pre>

   CAUTION: Run the above manually. Do not put the above commands in a script stored in GitHub.

   https://www.pdq.com/blog/secure-password-with-powershell-encrypting-credentials-part-1/

   NOTE: There is no CLI Bash equivalent for this.

1. The value of $securePasswords can now be saved in a file which exports an environment variable. You still should not hard-code encryption keys in code so that it can be cracked over a long period of time by powerful computers.

1. To unencrypted secret (under the same account) within a sample command:

   <pre>$myapp = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName '...' -HomePage 'http://...' -IdentifierUris 'http://...' <strong>-Password $securePassword</strong>
   </pre>

   NOTE: You don't have to unencrypt first. Microsoft's commands handle that for you. Cool, eh?

https://www.guardicore.com/cyber-security-platform/


<a name="Terraform"></a>

## Terraform on Azure

1. PROTIP: A Terraform client is pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell.

   <pre><strong>terraform version</strong></pre>
   
   Ignore the version upgrade message. Azure keeps it up to date as appropriate.

<a name="Create_Resource_Group"></a>

## Create Resource Groups

   DEFINITION: A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure: virtual machines, Application Gateways, CosmosDB instances, etc. Many resources can be moved between resource groups.  

   Resource groups also define a <strong>scope</strong> for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions which limit access to allow only what is needed.

1. Create resource group (under a subscription) for location, after viewing briefings on CLI Bash or Storage (if you haven't already):

   <pre><start>az group create --name $MY_RG --location $MY_LOC
   </start></pre>

   Alternately, for more commentary, use the portal GUI:

1. Optionally: Drag and drop "Resource Groups" Home menu item to the bottom of the list. That's because you can ...
1. PROTIP: Hold down G and press <strong>R</strong> for <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups">Resource Groups</a>. 
1. PROTIP: Hold down G and press <strong>,</strong> (comma) to focus on the command bar.
1. If "+ Create" is highlighted, press Enter to invoke it.
1. Select the appropriate <a href="#Subscription">Subscription</a>.
1. Type your Resource group name using your organization's naming conventions:

   PROTIP: Include the region code in the Resource Group Name.

   Subscription code, etc.

   PROTIP: Resource groups have a flat structure: they cannot be nested like Management Groups.

   Deleting a resource group results in deletion of all resources contained within it. So resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once. That's great for non-production environments.

1. If you already know how to use CLI Bash and <a target="_blank" href="https://jmespath.org/specification.html#built-in-functions">jmespath queries</a>, get a count of Azure's regions:

   <pre><strong>az account list-locations --query "[].name" -o tsv | wc -l
   </strong></pre>

   68 is the response at time of writing.

   In 2021, Microsoft is building 100 data centers a year.

1. PROTIP: Beware that some regions are "(stage)", such as this table of regions with "westus" in its name, so this command and its results are not reliable:

   <pre><strong>az account list-locations --query "[?contains(name, 'westus')]" -o table
   </strong></pre>

   <pre>Name          DisplayName        RegionalDisplayName
------------  -----------------  ----------------------
westus2       West US 2          (US) West US 2
westus3       West US 3          (US) West US 3
westus        West US            (US) West US
westusstage   West US (Stage)    (US) West US (Stage)
westus2stage  West US 2 (Stage)  (US) West US 2 (Stage)
   </pre>

1. PROTIP: To list regions, use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blrchen/azure-data-lab/blob/main/Regions.json">github.com/blrchen/azure-data-lab/blob/main/Regions.json</a> which contains metadata about each region shown on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azurespeed.com/Information/AzureAvailabilityZones">AzureSpeed.com</a>. For example:

   <pre>    <strong>"availabilityZoneCount": 3,
    "availabilityZoneStatus": "3 zones",</strong>
    "displayName": "West US 2",
    <strong>"geography": "US",</strong>
    "latitude": "47.233",
    "longitude": "-119.852",
    "pairedRegion": "West Central US",
    "physicalLocation": "Washington",
    "regionalDisplayName": "(US) West US 2",
    "regionName": "westus2",
    "storageAccountName": "azsptwestus2",
    "regionAccess": true
   </pre>

1. blrchen's response goes beyond what Azure returns in its list all properties (metadata) for the "westus2" region:

   <pre><strong>az account list-locations --query "[?name == 'westus2']" -o json
   </strong></pre>

  <pre>[
  {
    "displayName": "West US 2",
    "id": "/subscriptions/32f0f1ee-690d-4b02-9e58-baa3715aabf7/locations/westus2",
    "metadata": {
      "geographyGroup": "US",
      "latitude": "47.233",
      "longitude": "-119.852",
      "pairedRegion": [
        {
          "id": "/subscriptions/32f0f1ee-690d-4b02-9e58-baa3715aabf7/locations/westcentralus",
          "name": "westcentralus",
          "subscriptionId": null
        }
      ],
      "physicalLocation": "Washington",
      "regionCategory": "Recommended",
      "regionType": "Physical"
    },
    "name": "westus2",
    "regionalDisplayName": "(US) West US 2",
    "subscriptionId": null
  }
]</pre>

1. TODO: Select the Region (aka Location) closest to intended users, for pricing, and have features available. 

   PROTIP: There are differences in prices among regions. "WestUS" is generally the least expensive among US regions.

   PROTIP: Speaker Recognition is currently only supported in Azure Speech resources created in the <strong>westus</strong> region.

   Individual resources created within a Resource Group are placed in the same region.


   ### CLI Naming convensions

   PROTIP: Since so many az commands refer to an Azure Resource Group, my scripts specify Resource Group or Location as the last item, using these naming conventions for environment variables:

   <pre><strong>MY_LOC="eastus"
MY_RG="azuremolchapter2"
az group create --name "${MY_RG}" \
   --location "${MY_LOC}"
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: Me standardizing means that you can use a different name safely by doing a "Change All" across all files.

   TOOL: <a target="_blank" href="https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-geodb-cities-api/">Lookup nearest city given Longitude & Latitude</a> using the <a target="_blank" href="https://geodb-cities-api.wirefreethought.com/docs/api/get-city-details#/">GeoDB API</a>.



<hr />

<a name="Tags"></a>

## PHASE 11. Tags

   PROTIP: Even while during individual development, take a few seconds to add tags in resource creation scripts to enable not just security, accounting, and logging processes, which may provide troubleshooting tools for developers from the beginning.

* To create a Tag using CLI:

   <pre>MY_TAG_NAME="$
   DELETE_DATE="2023-12-31"
   </pre>

   <pre><strong>az resource tag \
    --name "$MY_TAG_NAME" \
    --resource-group "$MY_RG" \
    --resource-type "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks" \
    --tags Department=Finance DeleteDate="${DELETE_DATE}"
   Env=TRG
   Company=MyCo  
   Sovereignty=Germany
   Project=Advance1
   Dept=FIN
   <a href="#Sensitivity">Sensitivity=HIGH</a>
   Customer=A3C2132
   Usage=Daily
   </strong></pre>

   REMEMBER: Each tag is for a specfic region, Resource Type, Resource Group.

   REMEMBER: Tags do not cascade via inheritance like permissions unless a policy allows that.
   Child resources don’t inherit tags from group level.

   NAMING CONVENTION: Tags are named with Title Case.
   Each tag is a "name=value" pair such as 
   </pre>

   PROTIP: CAUTION: Customer name can be considered confidential, so mask its value with a synonym value in Tags.
   The same goes for any sensitive value.


   ### Sensitivity 

   DEFINITION: "Sensitivity" refers to the security classification of data tagged.

   PROTIP: The Sensitivity value should be the same SENSITIVITY CLASSIFICATION RANK as used in <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/add-sensitivity-classification-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16">classifying within MS-SQL</a>: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

   Classification label should also correspond to <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/aip-classification-and-protection">Azure Information Protection (AIP)</a> which uses <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms">Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS)</a> to protect data with uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies:

   * Personal
   * Public
   * General
   * Confidential
   * Highly Confidential
   <br /><br />

* Using portal GUI:

1. Get to "Tags" service:

   https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/TagsBlade

1. Click "Review + create" if you are not using Tags or if the resource doesn't support tags.
1. Click "Next: Tags" if you can specify one according to your Tag Naming Convention:

   LIMIT PROTIPS: Up to 50 Tags can be associated with each resource.<br />
   Tag names are limited to 512 characters.<br />
   Tag names for storage accounts have a limit of 128 characters.<br />
   Tag values can be up to 256.<br />

   Tags are your own metadata for:
   * Searching
   * Viewing
   * Billing
   <br /><br />

   Each tag value is limited to 256 characters for all types of resources. 
   * Environment=Production or Staging or "NPT" (Non-Production/Test)
   * Department or Accounting / cost center Charge Code
   * Geography
   * shutdown=6PM and startup=7AM for automation
   <br /><br />

   Tags are not inherited from parent resources. 

   A resource be associated with up to 50 tags.

1. Click "Create" after "Validation passed".

   

   ### Lock RG to prevent deletion

   <a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/new-microsoft-az-303/10009AZ303/10009AZ303-AZ303_153">VIDEO</a>

1. Select each production resource group.
1. Click "Locks" menu.
1. Type a name according to naming conventions.
1. Select a Lock Type: "Delete".


   ## More Policies 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/new-microsoft-az-303/10009AZ303/10009AZ303-AZ303_155">VIDEO</a>:
1. Click <strong>Policies</strong> in the menu within a Resource Group blade.
1. Click Definitions in the menu for a list of pre-defined policies under each scope (Subscription + Resource Group).
1. Click "Policy definition" in the command bar.
   * Field "Definition location" is the Subscription.
   * Each rule is JSON syntax with "if", "not", "then", etc. logic
   <br /><br />
1. Click the blue button to the right of "Policy definition" field for Available Definitions dialog where you can select a Type and Search filter text.
   
   A common policy is Allowed locations.

1. Each policy can be set to Enforced or Disabled.
1. Optionally, define a Managed Identity for remediation.
1. Create.

   Policies can also be defined under each Subscription. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=ff82e602-05c5-4b71-b907-a011015d2859">VIDEO</a>: All Services -> Management Groups to apply governance conditions (access & policies) above.

   To group policies under an initiative:

1. Click "Assign initiative" in the command bar.


   ### Management Group hierarchy

1. Search All Services for "Management groups".
1. Add Management Group.

   An <strong>initiative</strong> describes a group of policies across different management groups, subscriptions, resource groups.

1. Click the group created and add more groups (up to 6 levels in hierarchy).
1. Under each leaf management group, add a Subscription.

   ![az-onramp-mgmt-grp-657x415](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/114475982-a20c4b80-9bb6-11eb-9891-2d4e4ceffb46.png)

   Also create management group by using PowerShell, or Azure CLI. 
   PROTIP: Currently, <a href="#ARM_Templates">Resource Manager templates</a> can't be used to create management groups.

   
   ## Policy creation

1. Select the <strong>Policy</strong> service.   

   Policies are rules stating which resources can be deployed to which locations
   * Microsoft provides a number of built-in policies
   * Create custom policies using JSON

   Assign at resource level or resource group level
   * Child resources don’t inherit tags from group level
   
   PROTIP: All resources in a resource group should share the same lifecycle.

1. In the left menu select the <strong>Definitions</strong> pane under the Authoring section.

   You should see a list of built-in policies that you can use. 

1. Click G+ for focusing on "+ Policy" to press Enter to create a custom policy in the New policy definition dialog.

1. Set the Definition location, click the blue .... and select the Subscription for the policy to be stored in, which should be the same subscription as our resource group. Click Select.

1. Back on the New Policy definition dialog, type Name value of Enforce tag on resource.

1. For the Description, enter This policy enforces the existence of a tag on a resource.

1. For <strong>Category</strong> select Use existing and then select the General category.

1. For the POLICY RULE, select all text in the box (command+A), then delete it.
1. Copy and paste the following into the box:

   <pre>{
  "mode": "Indexed",
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
      "exists": "false"
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "deny"
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "tagName": {
      "type": "String",
      "metadata": {
        "displayName": "Tag Name",
        "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'environment'"
      }
    }
  }
}
   </pre>

1. Click "Save".

   Uses for policy:

   * restrict which Azure regions you can deploy resources to.
   * restrict which types of virtual machine sizes can be deployed.
   * enforce naming conventions to keep a consistent standard across all Azure resources.
   <br /><br />


   ### Assign policy

   To enable the policy, create an assignment. Assign it to the scope of your resource group, so that it applies to anything inside the resource group.

1. In the policy pane, under the Authoring section on the left, select Assignments.
1. Select <strong>Assign policy</strong> at the top command bar.

1. In the Assign policy pane, click the blue .... for Scope. Select Resource Group. Click Select.

1. For Policy definition, click the blue .... In the Type drop-down, select Custom, select the Enforce tag on resource policy you created, then click Select.

1. Select Next to go to the Parameters pane.

1. On the Parameters pane, for Tag name enter Department.

1. Click "Review + create" then "Create" to create the assignment.






   <a name="NewResource"></a>

   ### New Individual Resource

   DEFINITION: Each Azure resource is an <strong>instance</strong> of a service you have <strong>already provisioned</strong>.

1. For a New Resource, hold down G and press <strong>N</strong> to select a new resource from Azure's <strong>Marketplace</strong> of services.

   NOTE: This is also reached by clicking "+ Create a resource" or Home icon then "+ Create a resource".

   ### Favorites

1. Within the Marketplace of services/resources, clicking the star icon labeled "Favorites" adds the item to the <a href="#Dashboard">Dashboard (described in a section below)</a>.

   ### New Web App
   
   PROTIP: Launching a "Web App" means that you provision a VM (Virtual Machine) which incur charges continuously (until you go broke). A server is used to generate HTML and CSS files as needed (real-time) based on requests from users.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/socialize/index/type/community_post/id/16110">DOC: "Launching a Simple Web App in Azure"</a>


   <a name="NewStaticWebApp"></a>

   ### New Static Web App

   "Static web apps" serve the same (static) HTML and CSS files to all users pre-generated when saved (pushed) to GitHub. This means that users don't have to wait for them to be generated.
   
1. In another browser tab, sign into GitHub and create a repository containing Nuxt.js or other template to generate HTML and CSS files.

1. Scroll down the "Azure Marketplace" menu to click "Web".
1. Click "Static Web App (preview)".
1. Select the Resource Group created already.
1. Type a Name that follows your Naming Convensions. For example, "msftlearn-core-infra-rg-dev" consists of 
   * "msftlearn" for the types of resources 
   * "hr" for Human Resources, "fin" for finance, etc.
   * "core-infra" for what is contained within,
   * "dev" or "prod" for environment
   * "rg" for the type of resource it is (resource group)
   <br /><br />

1. PROTIP: WARNING: Select a Region that's the same as your Resource Group or you'll incur inter-region network charges.
1. For Deployment details: Source, select "GitHub" the default.
1. Click "Sign in with Github" for a pop-up screen to enter the email address you used to create the GitHub account you want to associate.
1. Type the code shown on your mobile 2FA (Authentication) mobile app to <strong>Verify</strong>.
1. Click "Grant" each additional organization/account.
1. Click "Authorize ..." to dismiss the pop-up.

1. You should get an email with subject:

   <pre>[GitHub] A third-party OAuth application has been added to your account</pre>

1. Select the Organization, Repository, Branch created in the step above.


   <a name="AllResources"></a>

   ### All Resources
   
1. Drag and drop <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll">All resources</a> in the menu to the bottom of the list because you can reach it without a mouse by holding down G and pressing <strong>A</strong>. 

   That brings up a list of all resources you have already brought to life.


<hr />

<a name="Region"></a>

## Region = Location

1. Go to Azure Resource Explorer:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.azure.com/">https://resources.azure.com</a>

1. To provides API calls and responses. Under your subscription / locations is JSON with logitude and latitudes of each location (region):

   <pre>      "id": "/subscriptions/.../locations/westus3",
      "name": "westus3",
      "displayName": "West US 3",
      "longitude": "-112.074036",
      "latitude": "33.448376"
   </pre>

1. On Google Maps, type in Search as "33.448376, -122.074036".

   Alternately, construct a URL such as:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://www.google.com/maps?q=37.819722,-122.478611">
   https://www.google.com/maps?q=33.448376,-122.074036</a>

1. Click to see it's in downtown Phoenix. (For security, that is not the exact location so Amazon can't drop a bomb on it).




### Install Entra ID Module

1. In Windows, right-click run as Administrator.

1. On PowerShell:

   <pre><strong>install-module -name azuread -Force
   </strong></pre>

   PROTIP: Module names are not case sensitive.

   <pre>Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you 
want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): 
   </pre>

1. Type "A" to response above.

1. On PowerShell: Load the module (no response expected):

   <pre><strong>get-module azuread
   </strong></pre>

1. Sign in:

   <pre><strong>Connect-AzureAD
   </strong></pre>

   

   PROTIP: User Role "Global Administrator" can do anything.

   There are many "Limited administrator" roles.

### Create AZ Role

1. To create an AZ role in PowerShell, define a JSON file then:

   <pre><strong>az role definition create --role-definition "~/CustomRoles/ReaderShpportRole.json"
   </strong></pre>


<hr />

## AZ API

1. Use the automation bash script for MacOS at 

   https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-install-all 

   The "mac-install-all.sh" script places a <strong>secrets.sh</strong> file in your machine's home folder.

   <img align="right" width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benc-uk/icon-collection/master/azure-patterns/azure-cli.svg">
   The script takes care of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">installing the azure CLI</a>

4. Edit the file there (not in the repo directory).

   If in the secrets.sh file the TRYOUT string is edited to contain a known value for a module, that would be executed.

   To execute all modules:

   <tt>TRYOUT="az-vm"</tt>

   Alternately, to execute only one or a few modules, for example:

   <tt>TRYOUT="az-vm"</tt>

   ... the Bash script has been programmed to create an instance using az cli commands rather than manually copied and pasted onto a 
   <img align="right" width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benc-uk/icon-collection/master/azure-patterns/cloud-shell.svg"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview?view=azure-cli-latest">Azure Cloud Shell</a> instance launched on an internet browser as described (using command+shift+V) at:

   <a target="_blank" href="
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-vm-tutorial?view=azure-cli-latest">
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-vm-tutorial?view=azure-cli-latest</a>

   * Log in
   * Create a resource group
   * Create a virtual machine
   * Get VM information with queries
   * Set environment variables from CLI output
   * Create the new VM on an existing public subnet (contoso.ws)
   * Verify public access to one-page static page (like isitchristmas.com)
   * Cleanup (remove vm instance if TRYOUT_KEEP is not specified)
   * Display cost of above
   <br /><br />

   Alternately, if in the secrets.sh file the TRYOUT string is edited to contain this:

   <tt>TRYOUT="az-func"</tt>

   This creates an Azure (Serverless) Function, as described in commands listed at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-cli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json&bc=%2fcli%2fazure%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest">Azure Functions</a>

   The unique aspect of the mac-install-all.sh script is that it does NOT require you to go from screen to screen
   typing steps by step starting from<br />
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions<br />
   
   The script executes a set of commands for you automatically
   so you get past the installation and configuration confusion,
   bringing your laptop to a point where you can work on changing the sample to the app you want.
   You can then re-run the script, and any changes to the underlying framework would be upgraded if needed.

   Since Azure provides a small amount of free time to all accounts each month under their <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#consumption-plan">Consumption Plan</a>,
   you can do several runs each month without spending any cash. See their <a target="_blank" href="``https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/">Pricing</a>.

   The RYOUT does the following:

   Account Password > Login > Tenant > Principal > APP_ID > Roles > Template > stop


   ### Login

1. For attended manual log in:

   <pre><strong>az login </strong></pre>

   The response expected is a new tab to appear in your default browser window asking for your account.

   Alternately, for unattended log in:

   <pre><strong>az login -u "$AZ_USER" -p "$AZ_PASSWORD"</strong></pre>

   If you have not signed up for a <strong>subscription</strong>, you'll get an error such as:
   "No subscriptions were found for 'None'. If this is expected, use '--allow-no-subscriptions' to have tenant level accesses"

   ### Set subscription

   There can be more than one subscription, so set to just to use:

1. The JSON that comes back from <tt>az login</tt> can be retrieved again by:

   <pre><strong>RESPONSE=$( az account list)</strong></pre>

1. Pick out the subscription from the list:
   
   TODO:

1. Set the subscription:

   <pre><strong>az account set --subscription=</strong></pre>

1. Set the cloud:

   <a name="TenantID"></a>

   ### Tenant ID

2. Once you have logged in, when you sign up for a Microsoft cloud service, Microsoft assigns to your account a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant">Tenant ID</a>. To obtain it:

   <pre><strong>AZ_TENANT=$(az account show --query 'tenantId' -o tsv)</strong></pre>

   echo $AZ_TENANT to yield something like: <tt>a7a02378-1e4b-4017-972e-9dfe53bc2b2f</tt>

   See: <a target="_blank"><a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh534478.aspx">
   Multi-tenant architecture</a>

   Resource groups (RGs) are used for RBAC, Automated Deployments, and Billing/Monitoring.

   ![az-ad-analogy-480x483-28094](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38739019-f324db20-3ef0-11e8-8c29-dd9ea31ddcd4.jpg)

3. Put the Tenant ID value in the <strong>secrets.sh</strong> file
   so that future script runs can check whether that value has already been created.

4. Also note that before getting here the script created a pem file
   PROTIP: Create a .pem file from the rsa.pub file named $SSH_USER created for GitHub:

   <pre>ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/$SSH_USER -m 'PEM' -e > $SSH_USER.pem
   chmod 600 $SSH_USER.pem
   </pre>

   This is recommended instead of the alternative of asking Azure to <tt>--create-cert</tt> in command:


   ### Service Principal

5. We next <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">
Create a Service Principal</a> using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions">
    Conventions</a> for naming principals under RBAC (role-based access control):

   This Azure CLI (command az) has the subcommand <strong>ad</strong> (for Active Directory)
   to create Service Principals (sp's). We capture the response (in JSON format) in the variable return.

   <pre><strong>return=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "$AZ_PRINCIPAL" \
   --role owner \
   --create-cert \
   --query ['fileWithCertAndPrivateKey, appId, tenant]
   )</strong></pre>

   This JSON file the command puts in your $HOME folder:

   <pre>
{
  "appId": "<em>username</em>",
  "displayName": "ServicePrincipalName",
  "name": "http://<em>your app address</em>",
  "password": <em>passkey</em>,
  "tenant": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
   </pre>

   The additional <strong>--query</strong> attribute makes 
   
   The first of three fields (fileWithCertAndPrivateKey) requested in the query is parsed using this command:
   
   <pre><strong>echo return | tr -d "[ ] \" \"" | awk -F, '{ print $1 }'
   </strong></pre>

   To obtain the first part of the response, "/user/wisdom/tmpf14zjme.pem", which is used in subsequent commands.

   <tt><strong>AZ_PEM_LOC="echo return | tr -d "[ ] \" \"" | awk -F, '{ print $2 }'"
   </strong></tt>

   The second item in the query in the command above yields the APP_ID:

   <tt><strong>AZ_APP_ID="echo $return | tr -d "[ ] \" \"" | awk -F, '{ print $2 }'"
   </strong></tt>
   
   The third item is the Tenant ID. Both of these are GUIDs.
   
   The command has additional options:

   <pre>az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "lnx" \
   --role contributor \
   --scopes /subscriptions/ssssssss-ssss-ssss-ssss-ssssssssssss
   </pre>


   ### Login for sure

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2aIVYxim-A&list=PLWag0-UcFD4HacGTnNVUzUMIsIF1CXySQ&index=6&t=3m28s" title="Oct 3, 2019">VIDEO</a>

6. Now we take the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://lnx.azurewebsites.net/directory-roles-for-azure-ad-service-principal/">
   NOTE</a>: 
   
   <pre>az login --service-principal -u "$AZ_APP_ID" \

   Microsoft Graph at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph
   https://dev.office.com/blogs/microsoft-graph-or-azure-ad-graph

   BLAH: The name of the file created contains something like "tmpcgzysdch", a random set of characters. 
   So the script needs to figure out that file name.
   Thus we create the pem file and tell Azure.

5. TODO: Obtain the password text from within the file 

   Create a folder <strong>$HOME/certs/</strong>

6. Put the contents in a file name containing the value in $AZ_APP_ID,
   in the $HOME folder so that it won't have a chance to get pushed to GitHub.

6. Login using credentials built above:

   <pre>az login --service-principal $AZ_PRINCIPAL \
   --username "$AZ_APP_ID" \
   --role owner \
   --tenant "$AZ_TENANT" \
   --password "$HOME/certs/$SSH_USER.pem"
   </pre>
   
   BLAH: The APP_ID and username are the same. Whatever.

7. Assign a role named "Reader" to the APP ID (username):

   <pre><strong>az role assignment create \
   --assignee "$AZ_APP_ID" \
   --role reader</strong></pre>

8. List what resources were assigned to a APP_ID:

   <pre>az role assignment list --assignee $AZ_APP_ID</pre>

   If your APP_ID has not already been created:

9. To specify a module to run (not just install):
   If in the secrets.sh file the TRYOUT string is edited to contain "az":

   <tt>TRYOUT="az"</tt>

QUESTION: limits to total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 100?

Azure Bicep > ARM > Terraform

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1691890796/az-bicep-1197x539_rfswrd.png"><img alt="az-bicep-1197x539.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1691890796/az-bicep-1197x539_rfswrd.png"><em>Click image for full screen.</em></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/bpczq"><em>from a PowerPoint file</em>.</a>

This diagram summarizes content in several <a href="#BicepDocs">docs and learn</a>.

For a specific subscription within a Management Group (deployment scope) in Microsoft's <strong>Azure cloud</strong>, the <a href="#Portal">Azure portal GUI</a> can be used to create <strong>resources</strong> interactively. 

Behind the scenes, an <strong>Azure API</strong> calls the <strong>ARM services</strong> to create, modify, and delete resources.

Microsoft's docs also talk about <strong>commands</strong> issued from <strong>az CLI and PowerShell</strong> terminals. These commands are also making calls to the same <strong>Azure API</strong> to create, modify, and delete resources. Additional commands can access services (such as Azure Key Vault) to manage <strong>secrets</strong> such as passwords and API keys.

Other security mechanisms include encryption, verifying identity, and strong authentication. To detect threats and intrusions, send logs to a central <strong>SIEM/SOAR</strong> system, such as Sentinel inside Azure or Splunk outside Azure. When anomalies are found, raise alerts by escalating emails, text messages, Slack, SMS, or other media.

When these security mechanisms are not created along with resources when created, it can be just a matter of minutes before bots discover vulnerabilities and hack your system. 
So Microsoft created the <a href="#ARM">ARM</a> (Azure Resource Manager) to create resources with tags and security controls based on JSON files processed together in a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline run by GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps). Several files can be linked together at deployment.

ARM works like Terraform and Ansible (from Red Hat), which have accompanying <strong>parameter</strong> files to enable different environments to be created from the same JSON-format files.

This approach, called <strong>"Declarative IaC</strong>, (Infrastructure as Code) is where the ARM service compares <strong>state</strong> and makes changes and <strong>deletions</strong> as necessary to achieve the desired state specified. Such "idempotent" logic achieves the same result each time the file is deployed. Duplicates are not created. 

The alternative approach, called Imperative or <strong>Programmatic IaC</strong>, is where application programming code written in Python, Go, C#, etc. call the Azure <strong>SDK</strong> (Sofware Development Kit). One such program is <strong>Pulumi</strong>. Such programs need to create resources in the proper sequence, check whether resources have already been created, recognize errors, etc. Although more complex and thus difficult to maintain and debug, programming code has the flexibility to do anything, such as sending logs to a <strong>SIEM/SOAR</strong> system.

For <a href="#BicepDX">better developer experience (DX)</a>, in 2021 Microsoft created the <strong>Bicep DSL</strong> (Domain Specific Language) read by a <strong>Transpiler</strong> that creates ARM JSON and parameters files. But the Bicep DSL code is also validated based on Azure API and <strong>OpenAPI (Swagger)</strong> files.

Note that, unlike Terraform, Bicep has no state file, so it <strong>doesn't alter and delete resources</strong> based on changes in the Bicep file. Instead, Bicep creates ARM JSON files that are processed by the ARM service to create, modify, and delete resources. 

Pulling Bicep code from <strong>GitHub</strong> enables versioning, and coordination with <strong>Jira</strong> or other product management tools. Highlighting and linting of Bicep code is automated by ARM and Bicep <strong>add-ons</strong> Microsoft has created for VSCode and other popular <strong>IDE</strong> text editors. Added "Integrations" enable the IDE to invoke the Bicep <strong>Transpiler</strong> to create ARM JSON files with parameters. 

Perhaps the most important security feature is the use of <strong>Policy as Code</strong> that can identify vulnerabilities in resources created by Bicep and ARM JSON. Issues found would stop the CI/CD pipelines, with alerts to the developer. This is called <strong>Shift Left</strong> because it is done before the resources are created.

Lastly, <strong>graphic diagrams</strong> can be generated from either the resources created or, better yet, from Bicep or ARM JSON for better visualization to speed understanding and troubleshooting.

Current status: As of this writing (August 12, 2023):

   * Unlike Terraform, Bicep currently does not have additional providers for 3rd-party offerings such as Databricks, Snowflake, etc.

   * Bicep is not yet integrated into the Azure Portal, which has a "See in JSON" link for each resource.

### Better developer experience (DX)

Creating a JSON ARM template requires complicated expressions, and the final result might be verbose.

But Bicep was designed to provide a syntax that's easier to understand, better support for modularity and reusable code, and improved type safety. 

Reference parameters and variables directly, without using complicated functions. 

String interpolation is used in place of concatenation to combine values for names and other items. 

Reference properties of a resource directly by using its symbolic name instead of complex reference statements.

Bicep automatically detects dependencies between resources. This process removes some of the work involved in template authoring.

Break down complex template deployments into smaller module files and reference them in a main template. 
This makes for easier management, greater reusability (easier sharing).

### CLI to create storage account

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP60ND7Upn4&t=38m53s">VIDEO: The imperative approach to 
create a storage account using CLI commands:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash
az login
az group param location string = resourceGroup().location \
   --location eastus
&nbsp;
az storage account create --name storagelearnlive \
   --resource-group storage-resource-group \

param storageAccountName string = 'store${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
param vnetName string = 'vnet${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
&nbsp;
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {

<a name="main.bicep"></a>

### main.bicep

In the <tt>main.bicep</tt> file, defining resources under <tt>Microsoft.Resources/deploymentStacks</tt>
makes them "managedResources" -- managed by policies associated with that top-level stack. 

See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.resources/deployments?pivots=deployment-language-bicep

The <tt>actionOnUnmanage</tt> behavior property of a stack can apply to the entire collection of resources under the stack - across all scopes (management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups).

Indeed, this enables one command to manage all resources (across several scopes) as a single atomic unit.
When the <tt>actionOnUnmanage</tt> property is set to <tt>Delete</tt>, all resources would be automatically deleted when the stack is deleted. That's convenience!

Conversely, when <tt>actionOnUnmanage</tt> is set to <tt>Detach</tt> (the default), resources are disassociated from the deployment stack but not deleted. This has the effect of protecting resources from accidental deletion, and thus a key benefit of using deployment stacks. It provides guard rails.

IMPORTANT: Deployment stacks entered public preview on July 1, 2023.

For <a target="_blank" href=" https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-governance-and-management/arm-deployment-stacks-now-public-preview/ba-p/3871180">example</a>, to create a deployment stack at the "sub" (subscription) scope with deny setting of "DenyDelete" and actionOnUnmanage of "Detach":

<ul><pre>az stack sub create \
   --name "storageStack-DevEnv" \
   --template-file "testStorageAccounts.bicep" \
   --location "eastus" \
   --deny-settings-mode "DenyDelete"
</pre></ul>

To verify:

<ul><pre>az stack sub show --name "storageStack-DevEnv"</pre></ul>

<pre>"actionOnUnmanage": {
    "managementGroups": "detach",
    "resourceGroups": "detach",
    "resources": "detach"
}
</pre>

</pre>

The "schedule: - cron:" lines can be removed so you don't want runs recurring automatically. 

### At the Resource Group level

I've parameterized the CLI script:

<ul><pre>export THIS_LOCATION="eastus"
export THIS_RESC_GROUP="demoRg"
export THIS_STACK_NAME="demoStack"
&nbsp;
az group create \
  --name "$THIS_RESC_GROUP" \
  --location $THIS_LOCATION
az stack group create \
  --name $THIS_STACK_NAME \
  --resource-group "$THIS_RESC_GROUP" \
  --template-file './main.bicep' \
  --deny-settings-mode 'none'
az stack group show \
  --resource-group "$THIS_RESC_GROUP" \
  --name $THIS_STACK_NAME
</pre></ul>

Because the deployment stack is a native Azure resource, all typical Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operations can be performed on the resource, including:
   * Azure role-based access control (RBAC) assignments
   * Security recommendations surfaced by Microsoft Defender for Cloud
   * Azure Policy assignments
   <br /><br />

    <br /><br />

Using Azure Policy is free for Azure resources, but there's a fee for Arc resources on-premises or in other clouds.

Popular governance actions enforced with Azure Policy include:
   * Enforcing the consistent application of taxonomic tags
   * Ensuring the team deploys Azure resources only to allowed regions
   * Requiring resources to send diagnostic logs to a Log Analytics workspace
   * Enforcing the use of encryption in transit and at rest
   * Enforcing the use of approved Azure resource types while in TST
   * Enforcing the use of approved VM images in production
   <br /><br />

Cost Control:
   * Restrict the SKU's of virtual machines allowed to be created
   * Avoid using Azure regions where the cost of a resource is higher
   * Restrict the usage of solutions from Azure Marketplace that can increase your costs
   <br /><br />

Security:
   * Enforce SSL connection to Azure MySQL database
   * Ensure authentication on Linux machines should require SSH keys
   * Ensure Windows machines should meet requirements for Windows Firewall Properties
   <br /><br />

Monitoring:
   * Activity logs should be retained for at least one year
   * Log Analytics Agent should be enabled for listed virtual machines images
   * An activity log alert should exist for specific Security operations
   <br /><br />

Backup:
   * Make sure all your virtual machines have Azure Backup enabled
   * Ensure that geo-redundant backup is enabled on Azure Database for MySQL or PostgreSQL
   * Ensure that long-term geo-redundant backup is enabled on Azure SQL Database
   <br /><br />

Governance:
   * Ensure the proper tag usage as well tag enforcement on resources
   * Audit virtual machines with a pending reboot
   * Manage your organizational-compliance requirements by specifying whether an SSL certificate lifetime action is triggered at a specific percentage of its lifetime or at a certain number of days prior to its expiration
   <br /><br />

Actions at scale:
   * Deploy Azure Monitor agent to all your virtual machines
   * Enable Azure Backup for virtual machines
   * Ensure auditing is enabled to all your Azure SQL Database instances
   * Ensure secure connections (HTTPS) to storage accounts
   * Prevent inbound RDP from internet on your virtual machines
   <br /><br />


    REMEMBER: Even if an individual has the Role access to perform an action, if the result is a non-compliant resource, Azure Policy still blocks the create or update.

1.  Click the "Definitions" menu link on the left to see hundreds of pre-defined Policy definitions.

    REMEMBER: Each Policy is assigned to an Azure Subscription.

1.  Click "Definition type". Individual Policies can optionally be grouped into "Initiatives".

1.  Click "Category". The list is NOT SORTED! So I prepared <a target="_blank" href="">this Google Sheet</a> to sort them:

1.  Click "Policy type". The default is "Built-in". Custom Policies can be created. There is also "Static".

1.  Click the "Assignments" menu link to see the "ASC Default" Initiative for your current Subscription Scope. 

    "ASC" is Azure Security Center, which consolidates security alerts from multiple sources.

1.  Click on that Assignment to see 335+ Parameters listed along with metrics status.

    Notice that you already have "Non-compliant policies" even though you yourself have not assigned any Policies to your Subscription.

1.  Click on "Non-compliant resources" to see resources that do not conform to the policy rule in the policy definition.

    Types of compliance: Customer, Microsoft, Shared. <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance">Regulatory</a>.

    Enforcement Effects are defined within the Policy Rule portion of the policy definition:

    Notice some are "[Deprecated]". The "Parameter value" of each shows its status.

1.  Click "Compliance" at the top menu for metrics similar to 

    Notice the "Initiative" is "Not started" because it has not been assigned to any resources.

    An Initiative is sometimes called a policySet.

    Many Policies recommend installing Defender services (for additional charge).
