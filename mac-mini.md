<a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Apple Mac Mini</a>'s $599 base price
is enticing. Apple provides a $100 discount to students.
Buyers using Costco's credit card get 4% money-back at the end of the year. That' $28.
Amazon offers discounts

## Use Cases

The big question is whether you can live with the base storage and memory for your use case.

Those who use Microsoft Office and a few light productivity apps will likely be ok with the base model.
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uuu046EE28&t=6m33s">VIDEO</a>:
Elevated used UL's Office Productivity benchmark to find the base model outperforming other mini Windows PCs
   * Beelink SER9 (R9 HX370)
   * Geekom GT1 (U9-185H)
   * Geekom A8 (U9-8945HS)
   * HP Stream 14 (R3 H370)

PROTIP: Many users may be happy with the base storage of 256 GB if they have the discipline to move files to an external SSD or cloud storage (e.g., iCloud or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal">Backblaze cloud</a>).

The question is use with editing videos using Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, etc.
or 3D graphics using Blender, etc.

[_] PROTIP: If you use an external SSD often, get an enclosure with cooling fan to house your NVMe SSD, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZVY133Q">$100 UGREEN M.2 from Amazon</a>. 40Gbps transfer speed. Lexar 256GB is $100.

The base 256 GB NVMe Memory can a later swapped with 512 GB, but you'll have to pay for it.

PROTIP: Those who need quick response when editing big videos and 3D graphics will likely need to pick the Pro model for more money. The decision to go with the Pro RAM needs to be made at time of purchase because
M4 CPU chips have a different physical form than M4Pro chips.

Normally the computer runs quiet. The fan comes on at 30dB.
When the computer runs at full load, the fan comes on at 45dB while running at 95 degrees F.

Fan on the bottom, with air entering from the front and exiting from the back.

Benchmarks found that the base unit consumers 2 Watts on light load and 20 watts at full load.
35 W max.
That's a third of what Windows machines consume.


## Physicals

Physically, the 2024 Mac Mini is smaller than the previous Mac Mini.

Power button on the bottom corner.
But there are 3D printed to put that on the side.
And many let the unit sleep and use the GUI to shut down anyway.

The mac Mini has a Tensor chip for Apple Intelligence features such as Smart Search.

Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax)3

Speaker is adequate.

There is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

## USB vs. Thunderbolt

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/HKoLxOkcfQ4&t=1m20s"><img alt="mac-mini-front-back.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1731683979/mac-mini-front-back_fup4cz.png"></a>

On the front, the 2 USB ports are Type C USB 4, rated to carry up to 40Gps and supply up to 100W of power.

On the back, the 3 ports are Thunderbolt 4 for up to 40 Gbps transfer speed.

Thunderbolt 5 cables are rated to carry up to 80Gps and supply up to 250W of power.
But they are expensive and not widely unavailable.

Thunderbolt 4 cables are rated to carry up to 40Gps and supply up to 100W of power.

By contrast, PCI3 cables are rated to carry up to 20Gps and supply up to 50W of power.


## Displays strategy

[_] If you have a single HD monitor to display 1920x1080 resolution at 60Hz, any HDMI cable can be connected from either front USB-C ports.

[_] To display a 4K monitor at 60Hz, get HDMI 3.2 HD cables to connect to a front USB-C port.

[_] To display a 4K monitor at 240Hz or an 8K resolution at 60Hz, use <strong>Thunderbolt 4 cables</strong> to connect to the back Thunderbolt ports.

[_] For two displays, one can be up to 8K resolution at 60Hz with a 5K also at 60Hz, get <strong>Thunderbolt 4 cables</strong> for the back Thunderbolt ports.

[_] For 3 displays, buy two Thunderbolt 4 cables for connecting to the back Thunderbolt 4 ports. One is a 6K display at 60Hz and the other is a 5K display at 60Hz.

[_] To connect up to 4 6K screens, the <a target="_blank" href="https://ivanky.com/products/ivanky-docking-station-fusiondock-max-1?ref=3gcsMvfWaBjc__">$439.99 Ivanki Fusion Dock 1</a> NEWOFFERS5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZVY133Q&t=1m23s">VIDEO</a> plugs into the Mac with <strong>>dual Thunderbolt 4 cable</a> for MacBook Pros.

[_] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Station-Triple-Display/dp/B08333333333333333">$169.95 Anker 575 USB-C Docking Station</a> (13-in-1), Triple Display, 4K HDMI, 10 Gbps USB-C and 5 Gbps USB-A Data, 85W Charging for Laptop, 18W Charging for Phone, Ethernet, Audio, SD 3.0</a>

REMEMBER: Thunderbolt cables may not support USB-C ports.

Thunderbolt cables are limited to 1 meter (3.3 feet).
Corning makes a $353 fibre-optic Thunderbolt cable that extends 5 meters (16 feet). But it doesn't work with USB-C.

* Hyper is working on a Thunderbolt 5 dock to support 8K displays.
