## Use Cases

The big question is whether you can live with the base storage and memory for your use case.
Those who use Microsoft Office and a few light productivity apps will likely be ok with the base model.

PROTIP: Many may work with the base storage of 256 GB if they have the discipline to move files to an external SSD or cloud storage (e.g., iCloud or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal">Backblaze cloud</a>).

The question is use with editing videos using Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, etc.
or 3D graphics using Blender, etc.

[_] PROTIP: If you use an external SSD often, get an enclosure with cooling fan to house your NVMe SSD, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZVY133Q">$100 UGREEN M.2 from Amazon</a>. 40Gbps transfer speed. Lexar 256GB is $100.

The base 256 GB NVMe Memory can a later swapped with 512 GB, but you'll have to pay for it.

PROTIP: Those who need quick response when editing big videos and 3D graphics will likely need to pick the Pro model for more money. The decision to go with the Pro RAM needs to be made at time of purchase because
M4 CPU chips have a different physical form than M4Pro chips.

Normally the computer runs quiet. The fan comes on at 30dB.
When the computer runs at full load, the fan comes on at 45dB while running at 95 degrees F.

Fan on the bottom, with air entering from the front and exiting from the back.

Benchmarks found that the base unit consumers 2 Watts on light load and 20 watts at full load.
35 W max.
That's a third of what Windows machines consume.


## Physicals

Physically, the 2024 Mac Mini is smaller than the previous Mac Mini.

Power button on the bottom corner.
But there are 3D printed to put that on the side.
And many let the unit sleep and use the GUI to shut down anyway.

There is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

## USB vs. Thunderbolt

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/HKoLxOkcfQ4&t=1m20s"><img alt="mac-mini-front-back.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1731683979/mac-mini-front-back_fup4cz.png"></a>

REMEMBER: The 2 USB ports on the front of the Mac Mini are Type C USB 4, rated to carry up to 40Gps and supply up to 100W of power.
   * Thunderbolt 4 cables are rated to carry up to 40Gps and supply up to 100W of power.

The 3 ports on the back are Thunderbolt 4 for up to 40 Gbps transfer speed.

Thunderbolt cables are limited to 1 meter (3.3 feet).
Corning makes a $353 fibre-optic Thunderbolt cable that extends 5 meters (16 feet). But it doesn't work with USB-C.

* Hyper is working on a Thunderbolt 5 dock to support 8K displays.
