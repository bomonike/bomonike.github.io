This article identifies the cheapest and longest lasting ways to heat and light a small room without electricity. Long burning because some burn out tending. Carbon dioxcide.

1. Passive Solar Heating

   Open south-facing curtains during the day to let in sun, then close them at night with thermal drapes to trap warmth. This is entirely free once set up.​

1. Heat rocks which dissipate warmth

1. Insulate: Hang heavy blankets over windows/doors

   Caulk windows and doors.

1. Heat just a single room.

1. Hand-Crank or Dynamo Lights - exercise

   These require no fuel or batteries—one minute of cranking can provide several minutes of light. They are good for backup or travel kits.​

1. Wood-burning stove (and pellet stoves)

1. Kerosene 

   Smelly. Kerosene fuel remains stable.

1. Propane Heaters

   Compact kerosene or propane heaters (like the Mr. Buddy type) are effective for small rooms and are relatively cheap to run. They use liquid fuel rather than electricity, and modern models include automatic shut-off and oxygen sensors for safety. Always ventilate and follow safety precautions.​

1.  DIY Candle or Terracotta Heater
    
    Group several candles under a terracotta pot to create a mini radiant heater. This works by trapping and slowly releasing heat into the room—cheap, simple, and good for emergency use.​

A.  Crisco oil

    $? semi solid + regular candles.

B.  Lamp oil

    Some claim "long burning".
    But how long will an ounce of fuel last?
