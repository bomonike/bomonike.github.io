Building and using electronics and robots (mechatronics) are not on the current AP CSP exam. But that skill is becoming more important for many engineering degrees.
The ability to understand them at a deeper level is crucial for many jobs, if only to understand how your job is being replaced by them.

Many skills are needed to design, build, and service robots.
