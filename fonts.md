## Font files

For code editors on your desktop, you’re usually fine with either OTF (Open Type Format) or TTF (TrueType) fonts.

Fonts usually come with a license attached.

A font family usually shares the same design philosophy, making rendering in bold or italics visually cohesive and organized.

Monospace fonts popular among coders because they make the amount of whitespace clear, and improves alignment and readability. That reduces wasting time on bugs.

Monospace fonts is often designed with a slash or a dot through the number zero character also used in Scandanavian/Nordic languages.

## Linux Fonts folder

On Kali and other Debian distributions, Truetype fonts are installed in folder <tt>/usr/share/fonts/truetype</tt> - so copy .ttf font files there.

## Easy install via Homebrew Fonts

The easiest way to install free fonts is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://caskroom.github.io">Homebrew Caskroom</a>.

1. First, do this command one time to configure:

   <pre><strong>brew tap caskroom/fonts
   </strong></pre>

3. For each font you want installed. The most popular are:

   <tt><strong>brew install --cask font-open-sans

   PROTIP: This draws from font-open-sans.rb at
   https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/blob/master/Casks/font-open-sans.rb

## Bitmap vs vector

There are two ways fonts are drawn - as bitmaps as static dots in a bitmap file or as
<strong>vectors</strong> drawn dynamically by a program.

Vector fonts look better on Apple monitors (with 1080p HD and above)
because they allow more efficient scaling.

When using old monitors with lower resolution below 720p,
bitmap fonts are better because they are generally more legible at smaller sizes on low-resolution screens.


## Mono-spaced Programming Fonts

I am not satisfied with standard fonts to display programming code.

Characters should be clear, easy to read, in cases of clashing ones such as 1, l, i or O, o, 0 easily distinguishable, differences between different kinds of brackets, quotes and parentheses should be clear, punctuation should be emphasized and they shouldn't break up words or sentences due to uneven character widths.

My main criteria is a <strong>narrow</strong> font so more characters fit on a line.

* https://www.slant.co/topics/67/viewpoints/7/~programming-fonts~ubuntu-mono
   It has a weird "m".

* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro
  described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Pro

* Consolas is not proportional, so columns line up.

### Meslo LG Multi-Platform

Now one would think that Apple engineers are rather particular about fonts.

Since Snow Leopard, Menlo-Regular is the default font for Apple’s
developer tools and the Terminal.
(which is a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono).

But no.

One guy has nitpicky gripes with it:

   * The default vertical (line) spacing is just way too cramped

   * The horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk is off

So he created a customized version of Apple’s font.

   https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font

His website has a "DZ" edition with dots inside zeros so no one can confuse them for upper case letter O.

   https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font/blob/master/dist/v1.2.1/Meslo%20LG%20v1.2.1.zip

Thanks to his work, we now have a good fixed-sized font that works across Mac and Windows.

## Dylexia Fonts #

Verdana is not only a casual, fun-looking font, but one that makes it easier to read for those with mild Dylexia.
Dyslexia is one of the most prevalent learning disabilities, affecting the lives of around 15-20% of the world’s population.

Dyslexia-friendly fonts typically feature:
   * Simplified Letter Shapes: Reducing confusion between similar letters like "b" and "d"
   * Clear Letter Spacing: Preventing crowding and overlapping of letters
   * Prominent Ascenders and Descenders: Improving letter recognition
   * Uniform Letter Height: Reducing letter rotation or flipping
   * Open and Rounded Shapes: Enhancing letter distinction

* Verdana is often regarded as one of the most dyslexia-friendly fonts due to its clear and simple letter shapes, generous spacing, and uniformity. This font was originally released in 1996 by Microsoft and has been a popular preference by many dyslexic readers.

* Lexend is designed specifically to be highly readable and accessible for individuals with dyslexia. It incorporates features such as clear letter shapes, consistent spacing, and optimized legibility. At Recite Me we actually use the Lexend font for content that we produce and display on our website.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.k-type.com/fonts/lexie-readable/">Lexie Readable</a> is a font designed with dyslexia in mind, with non-symmetrical b and d, and the handwritten forms of a and g. Its marker-drawn feel is similar to Vincent Connare’s Comic Sans that children find easiest to read, but without the comic book associations. Lexie Regular & Bold are free to download for personal, educational and charity use.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/font-open-dyslexic-nerd-font">OpenDyslexic</a> has weighted bottoms, unique letter shapes.

   brew install --cask font-open-dyslexic-nerd-font

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dyslexiefont.com/">https://www.dyslexiefont.com</a>
   Home Edition (or Education or Business).

## Anti-OCR fonts

For when you don't want your text to be recognized by Tesseract or other Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scanning software.

pdf ocrx extract text from PDF files.

<a target="_blank" href="http://videos.komando.com/watch/4124/kims-picks-new-nsa-proof-font">VIDEO</a>: ZXX fonts by Sang Mun, former NSA contractor, has 6 styles:
   * Sans

## Comic font to use in meme cartoons

Words in this cartoon meme, from World's Finest Comics #153 (1965), is changed to create various memes:

![fonts-comic-bat-slap-320x314-61000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/47255706-82a36600-d432-11e8-81dc-39272a5e639d.png)

It doesn't look right if one of the standard fonts for word processing are used on comics such as this.

It's more appropriate to use Neale Davidson's Comic Book font is at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dafont.com/comic-book.font">https://www.dafont.com/comic-book.font</a>

Instead of using a scan, which looks pixelated, Miles Goodhew at <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.m0les.com/2012/12/bat-slap-retro-vectored.html">http://blog.m0les.com/2012/12/bat-slap-retro-vectored.html</a> vectorized it into an SVG file using the <a target="_blank" href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> open-source drawing program.
