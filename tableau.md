Tableau enables everyone to gain insights from raw data by providing a drag-and-drop UI working on data in many formats.
In the biz it's called a visual Data Analytics platform.

## Alternatives to Advanced Data Analytics

Tableau's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/products#video">promo video</a> says:

Gartner's Feb. 2021 Magic Quadrant has Tableau trailing Microsoft in both Strategy and "Ability to Execute".

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-254T1IQX&ct=210202/">
<img alt="tableau-gartner-2021-570x592" width="570" height="592" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/159911415-ecc4359b-fee2-468c-bbeb-0f41fa91f119.png"></a>

Gartner notes "Tableau does not directly compete with other vendors with a strategy for being a broad BI platform offering. Tableau complements fully functional enterprise BI platforms that lack ADV capabilities."
That is why <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/forrester-advanced-data-visualization-platforms"> This Forrester report (although rather dated from 2012)</a> has Tableau lagging on the horizontal strategy dimension:

<img width="550" alt="tableau forrester adv 2013" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12010835/88925420-ac73-11e5-9797-b0d484db016b.png">

The Gartner Magic Quadrant report in Feburary 2017 put Tableau almost neck-to-neck with Microsoft on the "ABILITY TO EXECUTE" scale:

![bi-gartner-2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/24077172/6fb5e634-0c1b-11e7-9578-a6a794643a86.jpg)

In the previous year's Magic Quadrant of Feb. 2016, Gartner's kept Tableau at the top
for Execution even though it downgraded most other vendors on that scale
while it acknowledged Microsoft's fast rise to be the leader in
Completeness of Vision:

![fig gartner bi quadrant feb 2016](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14320055/e129619e-fbd0-11e5-9a47-1dae7ca66d5e.png)

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/forrester-advanced-data-visualization-platforms"> The Gartner Magic Quadrant report in 2015</a> also put Tableau above other vendors on their "ABILITY TO EXECUTE" scale.

Another alternative are JavaScript libraries developers incorporate into their home-grown visualization solutions:

  D3.js</a>

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://nvd3.org/">nvd3.org/</a>

Tableau focuses on presentation rather than both presentation and statistical calculations by software such as:

  * Matlab
  * R, an open-source (free) software

## 4D Visualization 

  Since 2007 at
  http://www.gapminder.org/videos/
  Hans Roling, a professor of health statistics in Sweden, is
  an internet legend for his
  <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/18477762">
  "Joy of Stats" video</a> shown on BBC Nov 10, 2010 and Ted Talks.
  In them he shows his 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gapminder.org/world-offline/">
  Gapminder web app</a> which
  presents multiple dimensions dynamically over time (nearly 300).

Jeffrey Shaffer created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdoBuNNvVec">
a time lapse video</a> of <a target="_blank" href="

This chart is an example of traits excellent visualization software possesses: 

 * Dynamic data - update visualizations (in "live mode") as data changes in sources such as databases. 
 
 * Visual querying -  change the query by selecting or clicking on a portion of the graph or chart (to drill down, for example). 
 
 * Linked multi-dimensional visualization - selections made in one chart are reflected as you navigate into other charts.
 
 * Animation -   

 PROTIP: Dynamic (movie mode) is available only within the Tableau Public client,
 not when viewed on websites (as of 2016-01-05).
 
 * Personalization - give power users an in-depth view and newbies a simpler view, and also control access to data based on user- and role-based access privileges.
  
 * Actionable alerts  -  thresholds and parameters that trigger messages whether you're interacting with reports or not.

## Tableau's Architectural Components

Several editions of Tableau client programs can be installed on Windows and Mac laptops. 

<img width="474" alt="tableau mac program icons" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12008208/5ae8f75c-abe9-11e5-911d-534176a8e0ab.png">

The licensed Desktop edition can read more types of data sources. 

<img width="589" alt="tableau components v06" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12034893/1611fe8c-adf4-11e5-8023-b9444e536535.png">

The Tableau Public website (http://public.tableausoftware.com) provides a gallery 
for showing workbooks created using the Public edition of client software. 
Tableau limits public workbooks up to 1 GB large containing up to 100,000 data rows.

Tableau also does not allow the Public client to store files locally on a laptop.

PROTIP: Use the Public client when you have reliable public network access.

The Desktop edition can retrieve workbooks from the Public website.
However, workbooks created on Tableau Desktop cannot be published to Tableau Public.

<strong>Private workbooks</strong> can be shared on a <strong>Tableau Server</strong> or in the Online service Tableau runs. A web app accessed using an internet browser is used to administer users on those servers. 

Tableau's native mobile apps on both Android and iPads make use of REST APIs
that other servers can use to access data. 

QUESTION: Can Mobile clients access Tableau Public?

https://gallery.alteryx.com/#!
is viewed using a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alteryx.com/download?src=sc113">
Alteryx Designer</a> Windows client.

The <strong>Tableau Reader</strong> client can read (but not save) packaged workbooks.

 Prices are subject to change at any time, and subject to negotiation.
 At time of writing, Tableau Desktop costs $1999. 
 Tableau Server is around $1000 per user or ~$200K for an unlimited user license. 
 Tableau Cloud costs $500/per user per year. 
 The Tableau Cloud plan includes 100 GB of storage. I do not know the storage add-on costs for groups wanting more than 100 GB.

Tableau makes use of HTML5 within internet browsers. 
It's unlike Microsoft Power Viewer, which depends upon installation of Silverlight and thus not mobile device friendly.

<a name="MobileApp"></a>

## Mobile App

Tableau offers native mobile apps on both Android and iPads.

* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tableau.TableauApp&hl=en
* https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tableau-mobile/id434633927?mt=8

The apps reskins the internet browser, which can also be used to access workbooks. 

0. Click Sign In.
0. For Sever Name, to use Tableau Public cloud, enter <strong>public.tableausoftware.com</strong> (without the https:// prefix). Ignore the "Tableau Online".
1. Click the orange <strong>Connect</strong> that appears to the right.

<a name="ClientInstall"></a>

## Client Programs Installation

The different Tableau clients are downloaded from separate URLs.

<a href="http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download?os=mac%20os%20x">
Tableau Desktop</a> Personal and Pro editions are licensed at $999 and $1999 per year to access a wide range of data sources.

QUESTION: Why is the Reader larger than others when it has less capability?

QUESTION: You don't need to install Reader if you have Desktop installed?

The Server <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/products/server/download/">
Download from here</a> only runs within Windows (32 or 64-bit) and uses Active Directory Authentication.

There are several ways to open a Tableau client program:

1. <a href="#ExcelOpen">Open Excel Samples from Local Data Folder</a>.
2. <a href="#ClientOpen">Open a Tableau Client Program</a> if you have your own file.
3. <a href="#CSVPublicDatasets"> Load CSV from Public Sample Data Sets</a>.


<a name="ExcelOpen"></a>

## Open Excel Samples from Local Data Folder

0. On a Mac, open a new Finder window.

0. Within your user's <strong>Documents</strong> folder, scroll to click on the <strong>My Tableau Repository</strong> folder created during client installation.

0. Click to drill into the <strong>Datasources</strong> folder.

   NOTE: The Tableau client remembers (encrypted) credentials to external data sources (such as Google Analytics) in this folder (as files with extension .tde).

0. Click on a version number of the Tableau client installed (9.2).

   There is a separate folder for each version of Tableau (9.2, 9.0, etc.) because 
   data structures often change with each new version.

0. Click on a locale (en_US_US).

   Tableau clients 9.0 come with an Excel (.xls) file 
   <strong>Sample - Superstore.xls</strong>.
   Notice it's 3.4 MB.

0. Optionally, click on that file to open it within Excel (if you have Microsoft Office installed).

   Within Excel, at the lower left corner, notice there are 3 tabs (worksheets) named Orders, Returns, People.

0. Switch back to Finder. To open .xls files from the Finder, control-click on the xls file and select Open With > Other ..., select Tableau.
0. For Enable: select All Applications.
1. Select Tableau and click OK to view in Tableau client Data Connection window:

   <img width="441" alt="tableau data superstore" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12007900/dec9ea0c-abd7-11e5-92a6-554639aa0884.png">

   You can also get here by clicking "Excel" in Tableau's Connect menu.

### Predicting Diamond Prices

In this initial project, students use results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much a jewelry company should bid for diamonds. 



### Multi-variate Linear Regression

To work through how a homegoods manufacturer can 
predict expected profits from a catalog launch,
students build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.

1. Download the sample data .csv files.
2. In Finder, double-click on the diamonds.csv file to open it in Excel:

   The training set contains historical data where the outcome is already known.

   The sample diamonds.csv has 50,000 rows.

   Outcome values are in the target variable (price).

   Excel needs all variables together, so:

3. Select the letter above the "caret" column to select the whole column.
4. Press Ctrl+X to cut. Click on the column heading to the right of the "price" column.
5. Repeat for the "clarity_ord" and "cut_ord" columns.


6. In Excel Data tab, Click on Data Analysis.
7. If you don't see "Data Analysis", enable Analysis Toolpack. This only needs to be done once. 
8. Select Regression and OK.

   Conditions of attributes are in the predictor variables,
   also called dependent variables or (in Excel), Y Range.

0. Click the red arrow icon for Y Range.
0. Check "Labels"
0. Click in row 1 "price". Press Command-shift-down to select the whole column

   $H$1:$H$50001

0. Click the icon to collapse the pop-up.
0. Press Enter.

   $I$1:$K$50001

0. Click the icon to Output range.
0. Cick cell M1.
0. Press Enter to accept it.

0. Click OK.

0. Variables with P-values (Prediction-values) beyond .15 should not be used.

   Regression equation models enable predictions to be made based on attribute values.

0. 

The test dataset (new-diamonds.csv) contains new instances.

To create a multi-variate regression in Excel:

### Select the Location of a New Pet Store

Students use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location for a pet store chain. 

<a name="DataAlteryx"></a>

## Data Transformation using Alteryx

   NOTE: In 2015, Tableau did not have an ETL tool.
   Tableau add-in Alteryx for groups wanting true self-service ETL
   like Microsoft Power Query M scripting (formerly called Data Explorer)  that does pivot/unpivot, joining, filtering, deduplicating, grouping, splitting, and transforms.
   
   http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/preparing-excel-files-analysis
   has some basic pivoting and cleansing features. 

  Alteryx performs Data blending of multiple and disparate data sources
 
  Alteryx does predictive and spatial analytics with no coding required
 
  Alteryx makes re-useable, modifiable workflows and direct updates to Tableau workbooks.

## Date Adjustments in Excel

It may be easier to adjust data within Excel before Tableau uses the file, 
which is the number of seconds from 1970 (not the number since 1970 as Unix uses).

Tableau doesn't read TIME according to  (as of Oct 12, 2015)
https://community.tableau.com/ideas/3315
and https://community.tableau.com/ideas/1054

* http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/supported-date-formats
* http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/fixing-date-fields
* http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/understanding-the-dateparse-function

Where A2 in the sample is replaced with wherever cell contains a date Excel recognizes,
to convert the text "2016-01-12" to the internal date number of 42381.00:

 ```
 =DATEVALUE(LEFT(A2,4)&"-"&MID(A2,6,2)&"-"&MID(A2,9,2))+(NUMBERVALUE(MID(A2,12,2))/24)+(NUMBERVALUE(MID(A2,15,2))/1440)
 ```

Within Excel, hours and minutes are the decimals of a floating point number,
such as .88 when the text equivalent is "21:40" on a 24 hour clock:

 ```
 =(NUMBERVALUE(MID(A2,12,2))/24)
 ```

To convert 40 minutes into the hour, divide the number of minutes in a day
(24 * 60 = 1440):

 ```
 =(NUMBERVALUE(MID(A2,12,2))/24)+(NUMBERVALUE(MID(A2,15,2))/1440)
 ```

The number for minutes would not be more than 1/24 or 0.041666667.

To convert UTC/GMT times to local time that is -8 hours for Pacific Standard Time (Seattle):

 ```
 =A2-TIME(8,0,0)
 ```

   NOTE UTC/GMT times are never adjusted for Daylight Savings, so the number of hours
   difference changes during the year. During the summer it's 7 hours. See
   http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20160114T00&p1=0&p2=234

   http://www.cpearson.com/excel/TimeZoneAndDaylightTime.aspx
   The LocalOffsetFromGMT() function 

To zero-fill leading zeroes:

 ```
 =TEXT(A2,"000")
 ```

As <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/online/mac/en-us/help.htm#environ_filesandfolders.html">explained here</a>:

<strong>.csv</strong> is a Comma Separated Value (character delimited) text format that Excel and many other programs open. 

<strong>.xls</strong> is a Microsoft Office Excel 1998+ format.

<strong>.xlsx</strong> is a Microsoft Office Excel 2007+ format.

<strong>.txt</strong> files are also considered among "Other files" that Tableau opens.

<strong>.tds</strong> data source files (as explained <a target="_blank" href="https://community.tableau.com/external-link.jspa?url=http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/export-data-connection">here</a>) are like shortcuts containing information needed to just connect to the data sources, such as data source type, location, and custom fields. 

<strong>.tde</strong> extract files (explained <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/online/mac/en-us/help.htm#extracting_data.html">here</a>) 
are a local copy of an entire data source (or its subset) created programmatically
using <a href="#ExtractAPI">Tableau Extract API</a>.

<strong>.tdsx</strong> Packaged Data Source files contains all the information in the Data Source (.tds) file as well as any local file data sources (Excel, Access, text, and extracts). Packaged means a single zipped file for easier sharing a data source with people who may not have access to the original data that is stored locally on your computer.

<strong>.twb</strong> is the native workbook. It does not contain any data, which is why a packaged workbook is needed.

<strong>.twbx</strong> packaged workbook files (as explained <a target="_blank" href="https://community.tableau.com/external-link.jspa?url=http://onlinehelp.tableausoftware.com/current/pro/online/en-us/help.htm#save_savework_packagedworkbooks.html">here</a>) contain one or more worksheets, plus zero or more dashboards and stories. These files are what is transferred to and from Tableau servers.

CAUTION: None of the above formats are encrypted with any data security.

<strong>.ttde</strong> are <a target="_blank" href="http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/shadow-extracts">Shadow Extract files</a> 
used for caching speed within clients
and not directly referenced by users. Five of these files are stored within a Shadow Extract folder.

## Public Datasets

The Client Pro certification exam uses the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://wildlife.faa.gov/">
FAA Wildlife Strike Database</a>

Tableau provides a <a target="_blank" href="http://mkt.tableau.com/files/Desktop-9-CP-Solution-Guide.pdf">Solution Guide</a> which shows constructed viz to answer the certification questions:

    * Do some species have more strikes in some months over others? 
    * Are there any species appearing in the top that are surprising? 
    * Calculate the strike rate (number of strikes divided by the number of total flights) to see if the rate of wildlife strikes is increasing or decreasing over time.

    * Where are these strikes most likely to occur?
    * Are there certain months when wildlife strikes become more likely?
    * Have the number of strikes per year been changing over time?
    * Does the number of flights have any effect on seasonal trends?
    * Combine views into a dashboard allowing users to explore the data themselves.

    Note that you should not be confined to a specific number of species per month and should use a parameter to make a dynamic Top N.

Get the sample dataset:

 0. Scroll to the bottom of the page to
 0. Click <a target="_blank" href="http://wildlife.faa.gov/downloads/wildlife.zip</a>
    "FAA Wildlife Strike Database"</a> link 
    without specifying any filters
    to download <strong>wildlife.zip</strong>.
 0. Unzip the file for a folder named "wildlife".
 0. Drill into the folder.
 0. Double-click on "wildlife.accdb" to open it using Microsoft Office Access.
 0. The read-me.xls file in the folder is the same as the one obtained by 
    clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://wildlife.faa.gov/downloads/fieldlist.xls">
    "total of 94 fields of data" for the <strong>fieldlist.xls</strong></a>.
    It contains a description of Column Names, Engine Codes, Aircraft Type, Engine Position.

 If you are using a Mac, because
    Microsft Office for Mac 2011/2016 does not include Access,
    you'll need to consider
    several options for reading the .accdb Microsoft Access database file.

  * The simplest option is to temporarily use a Windows machine 
    or a virtual Windows machine containing MS Office Access 
    -- if they are already installed and available for use.

  * The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actualtech.com/product_access.php">
    $39.99 ODBC read-only driver for Microsoft Access from Actual Technologies</a>
    enables Excel 2011 for Mac to execute SQL queries using Microsoft Query (comes with Microsoft Office) or a PivotTable.

<a name="Galleries"></a>

## Public Galleries

I think infographics are a form of art like paintings and sculptures. 
And beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
But clean looks are now preferred as being more modern.

PROTIP: To be good at creating your own, first get to know what others have done, starting from being able to name the different chart types.

0. Save the URL and click links to save workbooks to presentations that you might want to use.

   WARNING: Most data in examples are several years out of date.

These galleries show why Tableau is among the most capable and popular of visualization software, providing a rich variety of chart types to make sense of data.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/learn/gallery">Tableau's Gallery</a>
has URLs that are different with each new build of their website. 

NOTICE: The permalink for the current version is near the bottom of each chart.

<a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/">https://public.tableau.com/</a> 
is a social sharing site
for people to show and blog about their visualizations of public data sets.
This is much like what Adobe offers.

"VIZ of the day/week" from the Tableau Public sharing website is highlighted on the right side of the opening landing page on Tableau clients.

<a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/s/resources">https://public.tableau.com/s/resources</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAoXs9ej01qqIj6ti456tg/videos">
Tableau Smith on YouTube</a>, which has more videos than on the website.

QUESTION: How to describe changes over time? Videos instead of text blogs?

Vizzes by bloggers can be published on other sites, such as:

This "visual significance scale" is from SAP, 
but equally applicable for choosing how to convey a point:

The most attention is naturally given to the position of items,
with items at the top given initial attention.

<a name="StoryPoints"></a>

### Story points

(new since 8.2) A sequence of points, each containing a short caption. 

PROTIP: Have an initial point introducing the viz.

PROTIP: Pose a question the content answers.

 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/how-sun-controls-weather-0
 * https://public.tableau.com/profile/efields#!/vizhome/EarthquakesOnTheRise-Full/Earthquakestory enables users to select and provides a count of data points displayed on the map.
 * http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/story-points?reg-delay=true
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EhYY4gLt-c

<a name="TreeMaps"></a>

### Tree maps

Boxes show relative sizes of components in the box, such as profit contribution, etc. (As long as data are all positive numbers)

 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJuDk1RH2eg

<a name="HeatMaps"></a>

### Heat Maps 

Provide a two-dimensional set of colors to add a third dimension.

 * http://vizwiz.blogspot.in/2012/05/how-common-is-your-birthday-find-out.html
 

<a name="BubbleCharts"></a>

### Bubble charts 

Show different size and colors in bubbles to highlight the relative size of components that don't have anything in common with each other, such as sales from different industries.


<a name="Scatterplots"></a>

### Scatterplots 

Show specific XY points around a trend line of central tendency:

 * http://www.tableau.com/learn/gallery/website-traffic-trends
 * http://www.tableau.com/learn/gallery/survey-satisfaction

   PROTIP: Add the statistical r value such as "r=-0.74" to disclose extent of correlation.

### Bar chart stacks 

show the make-up of <strong>components</strong>:

 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/history-dow-30
 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/smartphone-breakdown
 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/what-music-matters-most-kexp

### Histograms 

Show the distribution of counts within a dataset.

 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/poverty-and-school-performance

### Pareto Charts

are a form of bar line chart that

### Waterfall charts 

Show the running total of each column

 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac7qfABRSBI

### Funnel charts 

presents stages, as in productivity of various sales activities leading up to a sale.

### Horizon (Trellis) charts

Show when occasional "bumps" (such as errors) occur over time:

 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/unemployment-horizon-chart
 
### Line charts 

Used to show trends over time. Segments show different categories.

 * https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/life-expectancy-country
 
### Control charts 

These have a thicker average line and upper and lower bounds.

 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsWJP0AClM
 
Box and Whisker charts (new since v8) display quartiles in distributions:

 * http://www.tableau.com/learn/gallery/two-weeks-home-sales


### Donut charts

 * http://vizwiz.blogspot.in/2014/12/donutcharts.html

### Radar charts

  Radar charts are great for visually identifying which of several dimensions 
  are possessed by specific sub-populations shown using cicle-ish lines in the middle.

<a target="_blank" href="http://evafengeva.blogspot.com/2015/12/k-means-clustering-analysis-of-red-wine.html"><img alt="red wine polar chart" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12368996/3abeb68e-bba6-11e5-9154-8ff05ea528e1.jpg"></a>

  In this example, one can see that wines rated good and excellent (in dark red)
  have high alcohol while wines rated as poor (shown in thick black line)
  have low alcohol.

<a name="GeoMaps"></a>

### Geospatial Maps

Geographic maps make use of geocodes that come with Tableau.

 * Choropleth maps color land forms to differentiate values.
 * Geo bubble charts overlay different size dots.

Tableau allows the use of WMS servers, GIS sources and custom shapes.

 * http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-mapping

 * http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/p/dear-data-two.html shows how custom markers can be added on a map by editing the map's CSV file.
 
   In version 9 define custom territories off a map and Tableau merges on the fly.
   Streets and satellite maps from Mapbox.com are supported.

QUESTION: How about custom plots (such as fields on a farm).

Tableau's VizQL is a visual query language which translates drag-and-drop actions into data queries expressed visually. 


<a name="Joins"></a>

## Joins and Data Splits

The sample Excel workbook contains Sheets named Orders, People, and Returns.
"Users" are used in previous versions of this file.

0. Drag one of the Sheets (Orders) to the canvas pane.

   Version 9+ automatically recognizes a "union (add rows)" drop target that concatenates multiple files containing the same headings.

   Version 9+ has an Excel cleaning data interpreter feature that automatically recognizes and stiches together subtables into a single data source.

0. Drag another Sheet (Returns) to the canvas.

   Tableau automatically suggests a join type:

   <img width="400" alt="tableau joins" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11996601/ba10d618-aa23-11e5-8c64-44044d1fa73e.png">

0. If a column contains multiple fields, split them into sub-columns:

   <img width="220" alt="tableau data split options" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11996699/ff0d9ed4-aa25-11e5-8411-c8281ace509e.png">

0. Because data is now loaded within Tableau, hover over a heading to Rename the heading to "Distribution Center".

0. Delete split sub-columns not needed.

0. Click on the data type under the heading name to change it.

   <img width="130" alt="tableau data type options" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11996668/3f0d7fbe-aa25-11e5-8057-ef16bf34f4aa.png">

   NOTE: You can later return to this by clicking tab "Data Source" at the lower left of the screen.

0. [3:06] Click on <strong>Sheet1</strong> at the bottom set of tabs. 

   NOTE: Each sheet is also called a <strong>view</strong>.

   You are asked to save the data.
   
EXTRA: [4:04] into video http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-data
shows linkage to add columns from another data source (Returns table) and inner vs left join.


<a name="SaveFile"></a>

### Save Live or Extract Offline

0. [02:42] Specify a Live connection to dynamically retrieve fast-changing data or import a static Extract for offline usage.
    
    <img width="305" alt="tableau connection live" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12008063/9b76621c-abe1-11e5-808d-199268544b0d.png">

CAUTION: Tableau does not save to disk automatically every few minutes (like Microsoft Office does).

If you save the file, the program suggests a name such as "Orders+ (Global Superstore)".

PROTIP: Add a version number to the file name if you would like to be able to go back archival generations.



<a name="Shelves"></a>

### Shelves for Dimensions and Metrics

<img align="right" width="368" alt="tableau shelves" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12010180/6382de08-ac59-11e5-8e24-e0a6c1124022.png">

   One of the amazing features of Tableau is it enables users to 
   create sophisticated tables and charts just by dragging and dropping, then clicking around.
   (By contrast, some coding declarative statements used to define visualizations in Kibana.)

   Each dimension element dragged to the Columns shelf defines a level in the hierarchy of columns.
   
0. [3:21] Drag from among Dimensions <strong>Category</strong> and drop within the Rows shelf.

   The three category values are shown in a table.

   "Pills" representing dimensions are color-coded blue.
   [4:19] Dimensions are discreet categorical text strings displayed in labels.

0. [3:25] Drag from among Measures <strong>Quantity</strong> and drop within the Columns shelf.

   "Pills" representing measures are color-coded green.
   [4:09] Measures are usually continuous numbers 
   such as counts, dollars, rankings, quantity, etc.
   These are the metrics we analyze and slice and dice.

0. [3:29] Drag from among Dimensions <strong>Segment</strong> and drop within the Rows shelf to the right of Category.

0. [3:32] Drag from among Dimensions <strong>Market</strong> and drop within the Colums shelf to the left of SUM(Quantity). Values are segregated across, starting with Africa.

0. [3:35] Drag from among Dimension Market again and drop it on top of <strong>Color</strong> (one of the Marks) makes use of Color to differentiate values.

   EXTRA: Notice a Market legend appearing when.
   
   <img width="400" alt="tableau columns and rows" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11996924/bc88bdc2-aa2b-11e5-9aec-0cbd44120c5e.png">
   
   EXTRA: Click on the Swap axis icon to swap X and Y axis (Columns and Rows).

   <img width="95" alt="tableau swap icon" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12041386/5f26cb0e-ae2e-11e5-915d-fccd02cac3f9.png">

<a name="DataBlending"></a>

### Data Blending

<strong>Data Blending</strong> is the combination of several data sets for integrated analysis. Although Tableau in 2015 lacked a data modeling diagram view, semantic model development is easy, rapid, intuitive and powerful with one or two combined data sources.

http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/connecting-google-analytics
notes that extracts of Google Analytics are limited to 7 dimensions and 10 measures.

Tableau’s standard extraction from GA is limited in that it uses Sampler.
So Google Big Query is a better approach for data extraction.

But <strong>Measure Groups</strong> pre-selects them

* Page Load Time (ms)
* Pageviews
* Sessions
* Time on Page
* Unique PageViews


<a id="TableauServer"></a>

## Tableau Server

The server enables workbooks to be organized into <strong>projects</strong> 
and assigned specific permissions by user group. 

<strong>Sites</strong> isolate multiple tenants on the same hardware.

* http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/welcome.htm

Tableau Server consists of several processes operating together at the same time
(all Multi-threaded and Active/Active HA unless specified below):

| Process | Program | Function |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| Application Server | wgserver.exe | log in, search, browse, generate static images, manage subscriptions |
| VizQL Server | vizqlserver.exe | Load and render requested views |
| Data Engine  | tdeserver.exe, tdeserver64.exe | load Tableau Data Extracts in memory based on queries from VizQL processes |
| Backgrounder | backgrounder.exe | run maintenance tasks and data extract refreshes. Not multi-threaded as it tries to use as much as it can. |
| Data Server  | dataserver.exe | handles requests to Tableau Data Sources. These requests can come from the Tableau Server or from Tableau Desktop users. 2x2.|
| Repository   | postgres.exe | store settings, metadata, usage statistics and workbooks. Single process runs Active/Passive standby. |
| Gateway | ? | ? |
| API Server | ? | responds to API requests |
| Cache Server | ? | holds items in memory |
| File Store | ? | provides files |

See the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/media/whitepaper_tableau_server9.0scalability_eng_2.pdf">V9 scalability report</a>


### TABCMD utility

Data for the chart above was obtained using Tableau's TABCMD utility at<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tableau/tabjolt/releases">
https://github.com/tableau/tabjolt/releases</a>

It’s not officially supported by Tableau, which is why many still use NeoLoad and LoadRunner,
etc.

Summary of the tech:

* Works only on Windows
* Perfmon counters are enabled in a dataretrieve.config file
* Workbook viz to run are defined in CSV files (not in a GUI)
* Server test config are in .yml files
* JMX used to retrieve metrics
* Written using Java with SWT for the UI.
* Uses ProgresSQL to hold run results
* Custom automation needed to manage files before and after runs

<a id="ExtractAPI"></a>

## Tableau Extract API

The 22-minute video at
http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/extract-api-introduction
explains the installation of Python 2.7.9 downloaded from
http://www.tableau.com/data-extract-api
which has both 32 and 64-bit binary Windows and Linux libraries using Python 2.7.9 or C/C++/Java.

[6:27] https://downloads.tableausoftware.com/tssoftware/TDE-API-Python-Linux-64Bit.gz
expands to folder DataExtract-8300.15.0308.1149

[6:42] PROTIP: Create a Modules folder within Python27 to hold the DataExtract folder.
cd to that folder and run the setup.py file:

```
python setup.py install
```

This creates files for this command:

```
>>> import dataextract
>>> exit()
```

[8:47] Open IDLE installed with Python.
