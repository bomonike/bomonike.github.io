## What Technical Singularity?

The history of technological innovation is that <strong>the rate of innovation is accelerating</strong>. The time for new inventions to be adopted is shortening at an exponential rate. New inventions are adopted at a quicker and quicker rate. It took GenAI (Generative AI) ChatGPT just 2 years to reach 1 million users.

"Technical Singularity" refers to rapid and uncontrollable technological growth that will occur when artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence.

<a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/TGuxwgUyu2A?si=IJsYnXq8dF8kTlSh">VIDEO</a>:
The sound of singularity (frequency going higher and higher as disk spins faster and faster).

This is also known as the "Infinite" Industrial Revolution because industry, infrastructure and transportation are <strong>continuously upgraded</strong> by software and smart systems.

The Singularity with profound and unpredictable consequences for human civilization
that few can predict today.

??? When robots take over work, people will have less and less to do.

The disturbing aspect of the Singularity is that it


## AI & Robots vs. Human Limitations

It's naive to say that "retraining" will fix everything.

Many retraining aim to create more automation which accelerates the displacement of human workers.

Individual humans cannot hope to compete with AI and robots like they can with other humans.

1. During the industrial era, workers can <strong>unionize</strong> and go on strike because managers cannot do the work of all workers. That's how workers can protect their benefits and
working conditions.

   But when AI and robots managers can replace human workers, human workers have <strong>no bargaining power</strong>.

   Reasoning

1. Humans degrade over time. Human replacements require repeated training.

   Computers and robots can work 24 hours a day every day.

1. Individual humans have a limited number of hours in a day to learn. And humans have a limited short-term memory and unreliable long-term memory. Humans learn from others slowly and incompletely.

   But what each computer learns can be added to a <strong>shared pool of knowledge</strong> accessible to all other computers. Computers can learn from each other quickly and easily.

   By definition, an LLM contains knowledge from many domains (medicine, law, finance, politics, etc.)

1. Human vision is limited to a small field of view and limited range of light and color.

   Robots can have eyes in the back of their heads, see entire spectrum of light, and remember precisely what they see.


## Making Money

What can you do to survive or even thrive in the Age of AI Singularity?

Logic? Imagination? Creativity?

1. Build AI and robots for OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Anthropic, Perpexity, abacus.ai, scale.ai, Tesla, etc. PROTIP: Programming and IT is not the only job within AI companies.

   o3 scored among the top 10 contestants in <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com">Codeforces.com</a> competitive programming solving complex problems under time constraints (2.5 hours).

1. Help others make use of AI and robots by getting ahead of changes and organizing knowledge for others.

   The GUI with AI is trending toward "low code" or "no code" (clickable) specification.

1. "Universal Basic Income" is often touted as a solution to mass human unemployment.

   The danger of "handouts" is that it can quicky lead to the rationale of eliminating the elderly and others who are not "contributing" to increasing profitability.

   "I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I'm rooting for the machines." -- Claude Shannon (1916-2001)

   Elon Musk's elmination of 80% of the workforce at Twitter within days of his acquisition is a harbinger of such thinking.

2. <strong>Sell to the corporate rich</strong>. Be an artisan to apply the fine-motor <strong>dexterity</strong> which robots have not yet achieved, such as being a robot repairman or worker creating luxury goods for luxury brands such as Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.

   There are a limited number of artisan jobs.
   Eventually, robots will create and repair other robots.
   Over time, there will be less and less superrich.

3. Achieve <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> by producing your own food on your own homestead.

   This is difficult, so requires collaboration with other like-minded people. Amish communities are an example of this.

4. Participate in <strong>underground ("extra legal")</strong> enterprises not subject to governmental authorities.

## Large Enterprises Government

The corporation which achieves AI Supremecy first will grow to dominate the world.

Elon Musk's success at funding politcal campaigns has enabled him to control agencies that were tasked with regulating him.

Elon Musk's X.ai built "Colossus", the largest AI data center in the world.

He has expressed a desire to enter financial payments (since he was an owner of PayPal).

As corporations will dominate the world, and the corporations will dominate the world.

## Future

Spiritual aspect

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/13/16-17/s_1180016">Bible Revelation 13:16-17</a> (NIV)

<ul>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
