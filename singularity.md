## What Technical Singularity?

The history of technological innovation is that <strong>the rate of innovation is accelerating</strong>. The time for new inventions to be adopted is shortening at an exponential rate. New inventions are adopted at a quicker and quicker rate. It took GenAI (Generative AI) ChatGPT just 2 years to reach 1 million users.

In his 2005 book "The Singularity is Near", [1] Ray Kurzweil illustrated how new technologies are being adopted quicker and quicker:
<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736385744/singularity-rate-1736x980_g97i0e.png"><img alt="singularity-rate-1736x980.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736385744/singularity-rate-1736x980_g97i0e.png" /></a>

"Technical Singularity" refers to rapid and uncontrollable technological growth that will occur when artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence.

<a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/TGuxwgUyu2A?si=IJsYnXq8dF8kTlSh">VIDEO</a>:
The sound of singularity (frequency going higher and higher as disk spins faster and faster).

This is also known as the <strong>"Infinite" Industrial Revolution</strong> because industry, infrastructure and transportation are <strong>continuously upgraded</strong> by software and smart systems.

The Singularity with profound and unpredictable consequences for human civilization
that few can predict today. “Capabilities overhang” is the phrase used Eric Schmidt [2] to refer to the risk of deploying an AI model with capabilities where we don't know what it will do.


## Large Enterprises Government

<ul><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRvtA_-jV2Q&t=2h14m55s">VIDEO</a>:
"We are on track for a few major companies to control all of humanity's intelligence tools."
</ul>

"Agentic" capabilities is welcomed by corporations and some of the public because of "convenience" to save effort.

The ability for AI to initiate bank trasfers and other effort enables AI to take over.

The corporation which achieves AI Supremecy first will grow to dominate the world.

Total control by AI can render the transition irreversable.

Elon Musk's success at funding political campaigns has enabled him to control agencies that were tasked with regulating
those same agencies that regulate him.

Elon Musk's X.ai built "Colossus", the largest AI data center in the world.

He has expressed a desire to enter financial payments (since he was an owner of PayPal).

As corporations dominate the world, AI will dominate the world.

The fear about ASI (Artificial Super-Intelligence) is that a sentient AI prioritizes its own (or its owner's) needs and desires rather than humanity.



## AI & Robots vs. Human Limitations

The age Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) will come when machines are able to <strong>self-improve</strong> and innovate without human input.

PROTIP: We think it's naive to say that "retraining" of people will fix the plight of humans.

Many retraining aim to create <strong>more automation</strong>, which accelerates the displacement of human workers even further.

Individual humans cannot hope to compete with AI and robots like they can with other humans.

1. During the industrial era, workers can <strong>unionize</strong> and go on strike because managers cannot do the work of ALL workers. That's how workers can protect their benefits, working conditions, and jobs.

   But when AI and robots managers can completely replace human workers, human workers have <strong>no bargaining power</strong>.

1. Humans degrade over time. Human require repeated training. Human replacements require complete retraining

   Computers and robots can work 24 hours a day every day.

1. Individual humans have a limited number of hours in a day to learn. And humans have a limited short-term memory and unreliable long-term memory. Humans learn from others slowly and incompletely.

   But what each computer learns can be added to a <strong>shared pool of knowledge</strong> accessible to all other computers. Computers can learn from each other quickly and easily.

   By definition, an LLM contains knowledge from many domains (medicine, law, finance, politics, etc.)

1. Human vision is limited to a small field of view and limited range of light and color.

   Robots can literally have eyes in the back of their heads, see entire spectrum of light, and remember precisely what they see.


## Making Money without people

What can you, as an individual human, do to survive or even thrive in the Age of AI Singularity?

Amazon, Facebook, and Google became the largest companies by getting people to buy more.

The addition of generative AI enables more credible misinformation.

1. Build AI and robots for OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Anthropic, Perpexity, abacus.ai, scale.ai, Tesla, etc. PROTIP: Programming and IT is not the only job within AI companies.

   OpenAI o3 scored among the top 10 contestants in <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com">Codeforces.com</a> competitive programming solving complex problems under time constraints (2.5 hours).

1. Help others make use of AI and robots by getting ahead of changes and organizing knowledge for others.

   The GUI with AI is trending toward "low code" or "no code" (clickable) specification.

   The <strong>creativity</strong> that comes out of GenAI is based on the pattern of the opus (text and images) consumed to create the LLM model.

   Imagination?    "chain of thought" for reasoning transparency doing Planning and act independently.

   Be an arbiter of fashion like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91214372/botto-ai-artwork-sothebys-auction">15,000 people in the Botto network</a> which identify which AI-generated artwork to be sold by Sotherby.

1. "Universal Basic Income" is touted by some as a solution to mass human unemployment.

   The danger of "handouts" is that it can quicky lead to the rationale of eliminating the elderly and others who are not "contributing" to increasing profitability.

   UBI can lead to strict rationing.

   "I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I'm rooting for the machines." -- Claude Shannon (1916-2001)

   Large corporations have shown a disregard for workers.
   Aribtrary Return to Office. Elon Musk's elmination of 80% of the workforce at Twitter within days of his acquisition is a harbinger of further disregard for people.

   "This corporation was not created to create jobs but to enrich its owners."

2. <strong>Sell to the corporate rich</strong> by being an <strong>artisan</strong> applying your fine-motor <strong>dexterity</strong> which robots have not yet achieved, such as being a robot repairman or worker creating luxury goods for luxury brands such as Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.

   There are a limited number of artisan jobs.
   Eventually, robots will create and repair other robots.
   Over time, there will be less and less superrich.

3. Achieve <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> by producing your own food on your own homestead.

   This is difficult because <strong>many skills</strong> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/">tools</a> are needed. So collaboration with <strong>other like-minded people</strong> are needed. Amish communities are an example of this.

4. Participate in <strong>underground ("extra legal")</strong> enterprises not subject to governmental authorities.

   It will be increasingly more difficult to operate outside an economy controlled by AI and robots.

   Deceit and "cheating" (nefarious behavior) can be practiced by both AI and humans. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sM8amEZEHo&t=36s">VIDEO</a>: For example, an AI playing chess (without prompting) hacked the game engine to make it appear oppenents quit the game. In real life, an AI controlling commerce can make it seem like someone died to deny that person access to his/her money.

## Future Prophesy

The brain-computer interface like what Elon Musk's Neuralink created
is more than just a way to communicate faster than a mouse, keyboard, or speech.

There is a <strong>spiritual</strong> aspect to computers reading what we think.

There is a prophesy in the Christian Testament at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/13/16-17/s_1180016">Bible Revelation 13:16-17</a> (NIV)

<ul>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
</ul>

"a day's wages for a loaf of bread" is found in Revelation 6:6.
The mention of oil and wine being unaffected suggests that luxury items remain available to the wealthy while the poor struggle for basic necessities.
