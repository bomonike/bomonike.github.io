## What Technical Singularity?

The history of technological innovation is that <strong>the rate of innovation is accelerating</strong>. The time for new inventions to be adopted is shortening at an exponential rate. New inventions are adopted at a quicker and quicker rate. It took GenAI (Generative AI) ChatGPT just 2 years to reach 1 million users.

In his 2005 book "The Singularity is Near", [1] Ray Kurzweil illustrated how new technologies are being adopted quicker and quicker:
<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736385744/singularity-rate-1736x980_g97i0e.png"><img alt="singularity-rate-1736x980.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736385744/singularity-rate-1736x980_g97i0e.png" /></a>

"Technical Singularity" refers to rapid and uncontrollable technological growth that will occur when artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence.

<a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/TGuxwgUyu2A?si=IJsYnXq8dF8kTlSh">VIDEO</a>:
The sound of singularity (frequency going higher and higher as disk spins faster and faster).

This is also known as the <strong>"Infinite" Industrial Revolution</strong> because industry, infrastructure and transportation are <strong>continuously upgraded</strong> by software and smart systems.

"AI" incorporates several levels of capability:

1. Chatbot: AI with <strong>conversational language</strong>. By OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 in 2022.

   Google Search lost market share to Perplexity.ai, which reads content from several sources instead of just providing links - a big time saver and improves security.

2. Reasoners: human-level <strong>problem solving</strong> (at PhD levels). By OpenAI ChatGPT o3 in 2024.

   This includes "low-code" and "no-code" solutions from AgentForce, etc.

3. Innovators: AI that can aid in <strong>invention</strong>. By OpenAI in 2025.
4. Organizations: AI that can do the work of an entire organization (negotiations, long-term planning, etc.)

The Intelligence Explosion from the "Situational Awareness" article by Leopold Aschenbrenner:

<img alt="agi-sit-1375x901.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1737377788/agi-sit-1375x901_vsc5af.png" />

AI is making worflows in all professions so easy that
   "The next billion-dollar unicorn company can be an organization of just one or three person."<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@nfxinsights">*</a>

AI is an “unmissable opportunity to catalyse a reindustrialisation of the US” in a race against China.

“Capabilities overhang” is the phrase Eric Schmidt used to refer to the risk of deploying an AI model with capabilities where we can't predict what the consequence will be.
The fear about ASI (Artificial Super-Intelligence) is that a sentient AI prioritizes its own (or its owner's) needs and desires over that of humanity.

## The players

* OpenAI (Microsoft)
* Google (Gemini, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRzYf2tETJM">Notebook LM</a>)
* Amazon seems stuck on Machine Learning and Generative AI
* Anthropic's Claude (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlwlGy0PUHg">being purchased by Amazon</a>)
* Grok (from Elon Musk) has no filters
* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/microsoft-expanding-ai-agents-365-copilot-early-2025/">Copilot Actions by Microsoft's</a> Outlook, Teams,

* <a target="_blank" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek.com</a> thinking model (from China) is cheaper at similar performance cores. Open source MIT license with open weights. And it's self-improving due to its reinforcement learning approach. Its teacher models can be distilled into smaller, more specialzed student models. It doesn't have image generation.


## Large Enterprises Government

<ul><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRvtA_-jV2Q&t=2h14m55s">VIDEO</a>:
"We are on track for a few major companies to control all of humanity's intelligence tools."
</ul>

"Agentic" capabilities is welcomed by corporations and many of the public because of "convenience" to reduce the toil
of working on emails, calendars, and such. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7OC5weZa_8">*</a>

Agentic software independents include make.com, n8n.

Agentic AI shifts the concept of humans initiating <strong>bank trasfers</strong> to computers able to initiate.
This enables an AI takeover.

Total control by AI can render the transition irreversable.

Thus, companies that are first to achieve AI Supremecy will be able to dominate their industry.

As corporations dominate the world, AI will dominate the world.

Elon Musk's success at funding political campaigns has enabled him to control agencies that were tasked with regulating
those same agencies that regulate him.

Elon Musk's X.ai built "Colossus", the largest AI data center in the world.

He has expressed a desire to enter financial payments (since he was an owner of PayPal).


## AI & Robots vs. Human Limitations

Companies such as Amazon are firing workers enmasse for "poor performance" as a euthamism for not being "competitive" against robots and AI.

The same week where said Zuckerberg said on the Joe Rogan show "AI will create new jobs",
Facebook fired 2,500 workers for <strong>"poor performance"</strong>.

The age of <strong>ASI (Artificial Super-Intelligence)</strong> will come when machines are
able to <strong>self-improve</strong> and innovate on their own, without human input.

PROTIP: We think it's naive to say that "retraining" of people will fix the plight of humans.

Many retraining aim to create <strong>more automation</strong>, which accelerates the displacement of human workers even further.

Individual humans cannot hope to compete with AI and robots like they can with other humans.

1. During the industrial era, workers can <strong>unionize</strong> and go on strike because managers cannot do the work of ALL workers. That's how workers can protect their benefits, working conditions, and jobs.

   But when AI and robots managers can completely replace human workers, human workers have <strong>no bargaining power</strong>.

1. Humans degrade over time. Human require repeated training. Human replacements require complete retraining

   Computers and robots can work 24 hours a day every day.

1. Individual humans have a limited number of hours in a day to learn. And humans have a limited short-term memory and unreliable long-term memory. Humans learn from others slowly and incompletely.

   But what each computer learns can be added to a <strong>shared pool of knowledge</strong> accessible to all other computers. Computers can learn from each other quickly and easily.

   By definition, an LLM contains knowledge from many domains (medicine, law, finance, politics, etc.)

1. Human vision is limited to a small field of view and limited range of light and color.

   Robots can literally have eyes in the back of their heads, see entire spectrum of light, and remember precisely what they see.

## Making Money in an ASI world

What can you, as an individual human, do to survive or even thrive in the Age of AI Singularity?

Amazon, Facebook, and Google became the largest companies by getting people to buy more.

The addition of generative AI enables more credible misinformation.

1. Build AI and robots for Tesla, etc.

   PROTIP: Programming and IT is not the only job within AI companies.

   OpenAI o3 scored among the top 10 contestants in <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com">Codeforces.com</a> competitive programming solving complex problems under time constraints (2.5 hours).

   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/VbVPF57nne8?si=W5clIH2xPyBEuGii">Michi Kaku:</a> (at time of comment): Humans are better at
   1. <strong>non-repetitive blue-collar</strong> work and at
   2. emotional jobs involving rapport with a human being, such as being a teacher, therapist.
   3. imagination jobs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-YbaSzDmhU&t=5m">Humans have "Taste" preference</a>

1. Help others make use of AI and robots by getting ahead of changes and organizing knowledge for others.

   The GUI with AI is trending toward "low code" or "no code" (clickable) specification.

   So become skilled in offering consulting services. Benjamin Rogojan’s Technical Freelancer Academy. Book: The Consulting Bible.

   The <strong>creativity</strong> that comes out of GenAI is based on the pattern of the opus (text and images) consumed to create the LLM model.

   Imagination?    "chain of thought" for reasoning transparency doing Planning and act independently.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-YbaSzDmhU">"Software Engineering costs will flatten out"</a>

1. "Universal Basic Income" is touted by some as a solution to mass human unemployment.

   But the money has to come from someone. Those benefactors can impose restrictions. UBI can lead to strict rationing.
   Historically, large corporations have shown a disregard for workers when they can. Aribtrary Return to Office. Elon Musk's elmination of 80% of the workforce at Twitter within days of his acquisition is a harbinger of further disregard for the plight of his workplace "family".

   "This corporation was not created to create jobs but to enrich its owners."

   The danger of "handouts" is that it can quicky lead to the rationale of eliminating the elderly and others who are not "contributing" to increasing profitability.

   "I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I'm rooting for the machines." -- Claude Shannon (1916-2001)

2. <strong>Sell to the corporate rich</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYB0SVTGRj4" title="If AI Takes All Of Our Jobs... Who's Going To Buy Everything?">*</a> - such as by being an <strong>artisan</strong> applying your fine-motor <strong>dexterity</strong> which robots have not yet achieved, such as being a robot painter or  repairman. Or worker creating luxury goods for luxury brands such as Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.

   There are a limited number of artisan jobs.
   Eventually, robots will create and repair other robots.
   Over time, there will be less and less superrich.

   Be an arbiter of fashion like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91214372/botto-ai-artwork-sothebys-auction">15,000 people in the Botto network</a> which identify which AI-generated artwork to be sold by Sotherby.

3. Achieve <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> by producing your own food on your own homestead. See <a target="_blank" href="https://bomoniki.github.io/skills">my list of skills</a>

   This is difficult because <strong>many skills</strong> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/">tools</a> are needed. So collaboration with <strong>other like-minded people</strong> are needed. Amish communities are an example of this.

4. Participate in <strong>underground ("extra legal")</strong> enterprises not subject to governmental authorities.

   It will be increasingly more difficult to operate outside an economy controlled by AI and robots.

   Deceit and "cheating" (nefarious behavior) can be practiced by both AI and humans. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sM8amEZEHo&t=36s">VIDEO</a>: For example, an AI playing chess (without prompting) hacked the game engine to make it appear oppenents quit the game. In real life, an AI controlling commerce can make it seem like someone died to deny that person access to his/her money.

## Future Prophesy

The brain-computer interface like what Elon Musk's Neuralink created
is more than just a way to communicate faster than a mouse, keyboard, or speech.

There is a <strong>spiritual</strong> aspect to computers reading what we think.

There is a prophesy in the Christian Testament at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/13/16-17/s_1180016">Bible Revelation 13:16-17</a> (NIV)

<ul>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
</ul>

"a day's wages for a loaf of bread" is found in Revelation 6:6.
The mention of oil and wine being unaffected suggests that luxury items remain available to the wealthy while the poor struggle for basic necessities.
