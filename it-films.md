## Star Trek franchise

Star Trek is one of the most recognizable and influential franchises in pop culture.

Star Trek is a groundbreaking American science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry. 
The series was inspired by classic adventure tales and sought to explore philosophical and social issues through futuristic storytelling.

Star Trek stands out for its optimistic vision of the future, when humanity has overcome many of its present-day flaws. The franchise is known for tackling big questions about morality, identity, and society, often using alien cultures as mirrors for our own. Its focus has always been more on dialogue, diplomacy, and ethical dilemmas than on action or violence.

NASA named its first shuttle "Enterprise" after the show.

In 2025, addition to numerous novels, comics, video games, and merchandise:
