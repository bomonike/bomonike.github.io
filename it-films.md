## 2001: A Space Odyssey

Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a landmark science fiction film based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke and stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and Douglas Adams. It is a masterpiece of science fiction, with stunning visuals, a gripping storyline, and a timeless message about the power of technology to shape our future.

"I can't do that, Dave" resonates as the film's most iconic line from a killer robot.


## Star Trek franchise

Star Trek is one of the most recognizable and influential science fiction franchises in pop culture.

"The Inner Light” episode of Star Trek Next Generation remains for me the most memorable and heartfelt show of any TV show ever.
[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZpZfJC21lM">The Art of Storytelling</a>]

Star Trek began with the original television series in 1966 about the starship USS Enterprise exploring the galaxy in the 23rd century: "To go where no man has gone before."

Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by classic adventure tales and sought to explore philosophical and social issues through futuristic storytelling.

Star Trek stands out for its optimistic vision of the future, when humanity has overcome many of its present-day flaws. The franchise is known for tackling big questions about morality, identity, and society, often using alien cultures as mirrors for our own. Its focus has always been more on dialogue, diplomacy, and ethical dilemmas than on action or violence.

The show is known for its impressive visual effects and set designs. The production value was high, and the sets were elaborate, with the USS Enterprise-D's bridge being a standout design. The technology portrayed in the show was ahead of its time and became a staple in science fiction TV and movies. The most notable technology is the holodeck - a room that uses holographic technology to simulate any environment, including historical events and fantasies. The characters also use communicators which inspired the invention of cell phones, and virtual monitors used as computers which are now used worldwide.

Some of the show's most memorable episodes include "The Measure of a Man", where Data is put on trial to determine whether he can be considered sentient and have rights as an individual, and "The Inner Light", where Picard is transported to a planet where he lives an entire lifetime in a matter of minutes. Other notable episodes involve time travel or interactions with alien races such as the Borg and the Klingons.

NASA named its first shuttle "Enterprise" after the show.
