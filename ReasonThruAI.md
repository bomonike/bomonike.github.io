When Generative AI burst on the scene in 2022, they were not able to count the number of "r"s in the word strawberry.

But in 2025, "reasoning" capabilities has been added to enable LLMs (Large Language Models) to <strong>explain</strong> how they solve multi-step word problems (using "Chain of Thought" processes).

To assess whether one AI version is better than another, <strong>word problems from academic competitions and exams</strong> (such as the SAT) are being reused. 

My notes at <a target="_blank" href="https://bomonike.github.io/ai-benchmarks">https://bomonike.github.io/ai-benchmarks</a> 
describes how <strong>individual researchers</strong> are constructing specific benchmarks (before moving to other jobs).

My concern is that this creates a <strong>reinforcement cycle</strong> where the same problems are used over and over again, leading to a lack of variety and depth in the assessment. 

## MY PROPOSAL: Make AI a benchmarking sport in high schools

Since <strong>high school students</strong> (and their teachers) are studying SAT problems anyway, provide them a way to <strong>input and compare</strong> how different AI versions solve problems.

This also provide opportunities for students to:
   * improve their prompt crafting skills
   * show off their skill at solving math, chemistry, biology and language translation problems
   * show potential employers that they can craft text prompts that extract value from AI tools
   * provide the world precise explanations of where AI can go wrong
   * generate a (potentially) large source of problems to benchmark/test AI tool

Prospects for high-paying work now are greatest for those who are able to harness AI. 

Thus, I am creating a YouTube channel and related collaborative websites for students to 
<strong>accept and display videos that compare how Chain of Thought across different AI</strong>,
whether working or not.

This provides diligent students a <strong>competitive advantage</strong> at getting paid work managing AI.

Connect with me and message me if you are interested in making this happen for students.
