ReasonThruAI.md

When Generative AI burst on the scene in 2022, they were not able to count the number of "r"s in the word strawberry.

But in 2025, "reasoning" capabilities has been added to enable LLMs (Large Language Models) to <strong>explain</strong> how they solve multi-step word problems (using "Chain of Thought" processes).

To assess whether one AI version is better than another, <strong>word problems from academic competitions and exams</strong> (such as the SAT) are being reused. My concern is that this creates a <strong>reinforcement cycle</strong> where the same problems are used over and over again, leading to a lack of variety and depth in the assessment. My notes https://bomonike.github.io/ai-benchmarks describes how <strong>individual researchers</strong> are constructing the benchmarks before moving to other jobs.

MY PROPOSAL:

Since <strong>high school students</strong> (and their teachers) are studying SAT problems anyway, provide them a <strong>way to compare</strong> how different AI versions solve problems.

This also provide opportunities for students to:
   * show off their skill at solving math, chemistry, biology and language translation problems
   * show potential employers that they can craft text prompts that extract value from AI tools
   * provide the world precise explanations of where AI can go wrong
   * generate a (potentially) large source of problems to benchmark/test AI tool

Prospects for high-paying work now are greatest for those who are able to harness AI. 

Thus, I am creating a YouTube channel and related collaborative websites for students to 
<strong>accept and display videos that compare how Chain of Thought across different AI</strong>,
whether working or not.

This provides diligent students a <strong>competitive advantage</strong> at getting paid work managing AI.

That's because contributors provide <strong>actionable feedback to AI providers and users</strong>.

So I am also leveraging my contacts among AI companies for sponsorship of credits for our students.

Connect with me and message me if you are interested in making this happen for students.
