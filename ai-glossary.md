## What is AI?

AI personality Bernard Marr <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/14/the-key-definitions-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-that-explain-its-importance/#22db12bb4f5d">identified</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=2191">four types of AI</a> evolving:

1. "reactive" machines (such as Spam filters and the Netflix recommendation engine) are not able to learn or conceive of the past or future, so it responds to identical situations in the exact same way every time.

2. "limited memory" AI absorbs learning data and improve over time based on its experience, using historical data to make predictions. It's similar to the way the human brainâ€™s neurons connect. Deep-learning algorithms used in ChatGPT widely released in 2022 is the AI that is widely used and being perfected today.

3. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=2191">"theory of mind"</a> is when AI acquires decision-making capabilities equal to humans, and have the capability to recognize and remember emotions, and adjust behavior based on those emotions. This was realized in 2025 with "reasoning" and "Chain of Thought" capabilities in LLM models.

4. "self-aware", also called artificial superintelligence (ASI), is "sentient" understanding of of its own needs and desires.


## Stages of AI

The 10 stages of AI capabilities: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK5EwG62hx8">VIDEO</a>:

   1. Programmatic (such as code in Python, Java, C#, programs) referencing <strong>rules</strong> (even dynamic rules)
   2. <strong>Discriminative Intelligence</strong> that discriminates between win/loss, faulty/non-faulty, herb/tree, living/non-living, etc. Such AI systems also perform tasks like classification, clustering, and regression analysis. Created by "content-based and Retention" systems (adapts: learns from data: RNN, LSTM, etc.).

   3. Narrow domain or Expert AI systems (on specific tasks: Watson, DeepMind, AlphaGo)
   4. Reasoning AI systems (simulates human reasoning on self-driving cars)
   5. Self-aware AI systems (reflects on internal states: introspection)

   6. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) human-like intelligence - flexibility at various activities
   7. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
   8. Transcendent AI systems (from book: Apocalyptic AI - merging with humans)
   9. Cosmic AI (extends beyond Earth)
   10. God-like AI (omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent)
