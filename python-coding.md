## Why This?

In <a target="_blank" href="https://bomonike.github.io/python-tutorials/">my python-tutorials page</a> I list the many tutorials on YouTube and paid subscription channels.

What I don't like about them I aim to fix on this page.

* Over-emphasis on games rather than practical usage that improves productivity, etc. Making trivial games cheapens Python as if it doesn't matter.

* Assumption that people invoke Python programs and wait to manually answer input() commands. In real life, Python programs are executed automatically. So provide data in CLI invocation parameters and CSV files. Verify whether all input data is correct before making changes.

* Lack of security features, such as retrieving API keys from a memory variable or (better yet) from a Key Vault rather that having them hard-coded in the program source code.

* Over-emphasize the use of a particular IDE add-ons which those who use Google Colab can't take advantage of. The most popular IDEs for Python are:

   * VSCode from Microsoft (free) has add-ons for Python, but some fear vulnerabilities from unknown authors. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/guides/visual-studio-code-for-python-development">BLOG: Setup VSCode for Python Development</a> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace

   * <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/#personal">PyCharm</a> (FREE or PRO $89/$71/$53 year)

   * Cloud9 free on-line on AWS (which automatically generates new credentials every 5 minutes or on browser Reset<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-modern-python-applications-on-aws/lecture/UdnyB/using-temporary-credentials-in-aws-cloud9">*</a>)

   <br /><br />

<a name="Exceptions"></a>

4.4 – Basics of Python Exception Handling

All instances in Python must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException. Before using a divide operator:
```
try:
    a = 10/0
    print (a)
except ArithmeticError:
    print ("microbit-001: This raises an arithmetic exception.")
else:
    print ("Success.")
```
* try-except / the try-except Exception
* ordering the except branches
* propagating exceptions through function boundaries
* delegating responsibility for handling exceptions

References about Exception Handling:
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_exceptions.asp">W3Schools</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">docs.python.org: Built-in Exceptions</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/python-raise-exception/">RealPython</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/python-raise-exception">code</a>

4.3 – Python Built-In Exceptions Hierarchy

locals()['__builtins__']

Python inherits from the Exceptions class.

* BaseException
   The BaseException class includes a <tt>with_traceback(tb)</tt> method which explicitly sets the new traceback information to the tb argument that was passed to it.
   * Exception is most commonly inherited type.
     * ArithmeticError when attempting to divide by zero, or when an arithmetic result would be too large for Python to accurately represent.
     * AssertionError when assert statements fail
     * FloatingPointError
     * OverflowError
     * ZeroDivisionError
   * AssertionError
* SystemExit
* KeyboardInterrupt when the user presses Ctrl+C or other key combination that causes an interrupt to the executing script

Abstract exceptions:
* ArithmeticError
* LookupError
* IndexError
* KeyError
* TypeError
* ValueError

## Debugging using IDE

See key/value pairs without typing <tt>print</tt> statements in code, like an Xray machine:
1. Click next to a line number at the left to set a <strong>Breakpoint</strong>.
1. Click "RUN AND DEBUG" to see variables: Locals and Globals.
1. To expand and contract, click ">" and "V" in front of items.
1. "special variables" are dunder (double underline) variables.
1. Under each "function variables" and special variables of their own. For a list, it's append, clear, copy, etc.
1. Under <tt>Globals</tt> are its special variable (such as __file__ for the file path of the program) and class variables, plus an entry for each class defined in the code (such as unittest).

## Pydantic

Pydantic at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">docs.pydantic.dev</a>)
is the most widely used <strong>data validation</strong> library for Python.

Use pydantic when you're not in control of the data input.

Fast and extensible, Pydantic plays nicely with your linters/IDE/brain. Define how data should be in pure, canonical Python 3.8+; validate it with Pydantic. Its success means it suffers from feature creep. There's a temptation to move other classes over to pydantic, just because pydantic also includes serialization.

It leans heavily on use of type hinting, which makes custom validation more complex than perhaps necessary.

So check if you can get away with dataclasses.


## Use Python Code Scans

mypy

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) looks for weaknesses in code and vulnerable packages.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) looks for vulnerabilities that occur at runtime.

https://www.statworx.com/en/content-hub/blog/how-to-scan-your-code-and-dependencies-in-python/

A. PEP8 "lints" program code for violations of the PIP.

   Other formaters: blake, ruff.

B. Bandit (open-sourced at https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) scans python code for vulnerabilities. It decomposes the code into its abstract syntax tree and runs plugins against it to check for known weaknesses. Among other tests it performs checks on plain SQL code, which could provide an opening for SQL injections, passwords stored in code and hints about common openings for attacks such as use of the <a href="#Pickle">pickle</a> library. Bandit is designed for use with CI/CD:

<tt>bandit -c bandit_yml.cfg /path/to/python/files</tt>

The <tt>bandit_yml.cfg</tt> configuration file contains YAML lines such as this to specify types of assertion to skip.

```
# bandit_cfg.yml
skips: ["B101"] # skips the assert check
```

Bandit throws an exit status of 1 whenever it encounters any issues, thus terminating the pipeline.

The report it generates include the number of issues separated by confidence and severity according to three levels: low, medium, and high.

C. <tt>safety</tt> checks for dependencies containing vulnerabilities (CVEs) identified.

https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/

D. <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/">Scancode</a> ScanCode scans Python code for license, copyright, package and their documented dependencies and other interesting facts.

E. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/advanced-security/demo-python">GitHub's Advanced Security</a> scans Python code based on <strong>CodeQL</strong> logic specifications.

### Time Complexity Big Oh notation

There is time complexity, data complexity, etc.

<a name="TimeComplexity"></a>

Big-O notation summarizes Time Complexity analysis, which estimates how long it can take for an algorithm to complete based on its structure. That's worst-case, before optimizations such as memoization.

From <a target="_blank" href="https://bigocheatsheet.com/">https://bigocheatsheet.com</a>, in the list of Big O values for sorting:

Let's go from the most efficient (at the bottom-right) to the least efficient at the upper-left,
where n is the number of input items in the list being processed:

* O(1) or n<sup>0</sup> is <strong>constant run time</strong> as more data (n) is processed. This happens when a <strong>lookup</strong>  is done rather than calculating. Examples are the push, pop, lookup of an array; insert or remove a hash map/set.

   Use of "memoization" is ideal, but is typically not possible for some algorithms.

   0Use of Modulus would result in "O(n)" (linear) growth in time to run as the dataset grows.

* O(n) or (n<sup>1</sup>) <strong>linear time</strong> occurs the increase in list size (n) increases the number of steps in direct proportion to the input size. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLTDT03QtU&t=176s">VIDEO</a>: This happens when
   * values within an array are summed together, in a nested loop through all elements.
   * during an <strong>exhaustive search</strong> though every item.
   ```
   nums = [1,2,3]
   sum(nums)  # sum the array
   print(100 in nums)   # search
   nums.insert(1, 100)  # insert in the middle
   nums.remove(100)     # remove from the middle

   import heapq
   heapq.heapify(nums)  # to build heap

   # nested loop (monotonic stack or sliding window)
   ```

* O(log n) or log<sub>2</sub>n - <strong>logarithmic time</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLTDT03QtU&t=10m56s">VIDEO</a>: occurs during <strong>binary search</strong>, (like ripping up portions of a phone book) where steps increase at a <strong>slower rate</strong> than input list size:
   ```
   | List | Steps |
   |    1 |     1 |
   |   10 |     4 |
   |  100 |     7 |
   | 1000 |    10 |
   | .... |    35 | horizontal asymtope
   ```

* O(n<sup>2</sup>) - n squared <strong>quadratic time</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLTDT03QtU&t=395s">VIDEO</a>: occurs in a <strong>nested loop</strong> when steps increase in proportion to the input size <strong>squared</strong> (to the power of 2). A <strong>selection sort</strong> starts from the front of the list, and looks at each <strong>unordered</strong> item to find the next smallest value in the list and swapping it with the current value. This is also when the minimax algorithm is used.
   ```
   | List |  Steps |
   |    1 |      1 |
   |   10 |     45 |
   |  100 |   4950 |
   | 1000 | 499500 |
   ```

  used to illustrate trajectories of moving objects, areas of shapes, and in financial calculations.
  𝑎𝑥<sup>2</sup> + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0

* n<sup>k</sup> - such as n<sup>3</sup> and higher degree polynomials are called "Polynomial time" to group run times which do not increase faster than n<sup>k</sup>.

* "Superpolynomial time" describes any run time that increase faster than n<sup>k</sup>, below:

* O(n<sup>n</sup>) - <strong>exponential time</strong> occurs when a algorithm looks at every permutation of values, such as all possible value which brute-force guessing passwords. For example, 28 to the power of 8 is when guessing 8 positions of 28 alphanumatic characters. When 10 number values and special characters are added for 98 possible values, it's 98 to the power of 8, a very large number. Such are considered "unreasonable" to make it harder to brute-force guess.

* O(n!) <strong>factorial time</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLTDT03QtU&t=18m31s">VIDEO</a>: where 5! = 5x4x3x2x1 - the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are used to represent permutations and combinations. Factorials <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/algorithms-101/evaluating-algorithms/e/comparing-run-time-efficiencies">determine the number of possible topping combinations</a> - graph problems such as the "Traveling Salesman".

   Used to purposely create complex calculations, such as for <strong>encryption</strong>.

The <strong>asymptope</strong> is when a number reaches an extremely large number that is essentially infinite.

Depth-first trees would have steeper (logarithmic) Time Complexity.

### Faster routes to machine code
By default, Python comes with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython interpreter</a> (command cythonize) to generate machine-code. When speed is needed, such as in loops, custom C/C++ extensions are created. Additional speed is obtained by adding before nested loop code directives and decorators:
```
# cython: language_level=3, boundscheck=False, wraparound=False
import cython
@cython.locals(i=cython.int,j=cython.int,a=list[cython.int],b=list[cython.int])
```

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLZphwA-dw">VIDEO</a>:
benchmarks Numba, mypyc, Taichi (the fastest). Alternately, code compiled using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exaloop/codon">Codon by Exaloop</a> tool <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/intuition/codon-a-python-compiler-3d5322e1c0a5">"41,212 times faster"</a> than the standard Python interpreter.

Condon is a new python compiler that uses the LLVM framework to compile directly to machine code. Condon can also make use of the thousands of processors on a GPU to process matrix, graphical, and mathematical operations without using a library like numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, and game library pygame.
However, Conda cannot use modules like typing functools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps">wraps</a>, which provides contextual information for decorators.

## Lexis

From https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-in-a/0596100469/ch04s01.html

The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, and boasts a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

Python's syntax is simple and consistent, adhering to the principle that "There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it." The language incorporates built-in data types and structures, control flow mechanisms, first-class functions, and modules for better code reusability and organization. Python also uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation, contributing to its uncluttered visual layout.

The language provides robust error handling through exceptions, and includes a debugger in the standard library for efficient problem-solving.

Python's syntax, designed for readability and ease of use, makes it a popular choice among beginners and professionals alike.

<a name="WhileLoop"></a>

## While Loop

CAUTION: What's wrong with this sample code?

<img alt="Insecure While loop" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1726233213/while-loop-password_zolqrg.png">

PROTIP: Passwords and other secrets should not be requested in an input() prompt because that would expose the passwords in CLI logs.

PROTIP: Passwords and other secrets should not be stored in programming code.

PROTIP: The way to verify passwords is not to store them as the raw password which the user typed in but as a hash of what the password the user typed in. The hash would also be created with a "salt" to ensure randomness. To verify whether the user provides the correct password, the program would add the salt to calculate the hash the user provides, then compare the two.

PROTIP: The user should be provided with a set <strong>limited number of tries</strong>. When exceeded, the user and IP address used should be locked out, entered in central (SIEM) security logs, and reported as a Security incident.


## Magic underlines

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoNOWVYKyo0">VIDEO</a> from idently.co:
Underlines in numbers are ignored by Python:
```
n: int = 1_000_000_000
```
Specify command separator:
```
num: float = 1_000_000_000.342
print(f'{num:_.3f}')
```

Right-align 20 spaces:
```
print(f'{var:>20}')
```
Center align within 20 | characters with the cap character:
```
print(f'{var:|^0}:')
```
The : character at the end of the string is a pass-through.

A colon after a variable begins a formatting specification:
```
from datetime import datetime
now: datetime = datetime.now()
print(f'{now:%d.%m.%y(%H:%M:%D)})
```


<a name="None"></a>

### Function return Not None

Returning 0 on error can be confused with the number 0 as a valid response.

So to avoid the confusion, return the Python reserved word "None":
```
result = safe_square_root(4)
<strong>if result is not None:</strong>   # happy path:
   value = result.pop()  # pop up from stack.
   print(value)
else:  # notice we're not checking for None.
    # calling function does not need to handle error:
    # an error occurred, but encapsulated to be forwarded and processed upstream:
    print("unable to compute square root")
```

Function:
```
def safe_square_root(x):
    try:
        return [math.sqrt(x)]   # in a stack.
    except ValueError:
        return None   # using reserved word.
```

The <strong>parameter</strong> (x) is what is declared going into the function.

The value passed through when calling the function is called an <strong>argument</strong>.


<a name="Operators"></a>

## Operators

DEFINITION: Walrun operator <strong>:=</strong>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0vFRnEv16I">VID1</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEMDi9mTCiU">VID2</a>


### Floor division Operators

This feature was added in Python 3.

<tt>11 // 5</tt> uses <a target="_blank" href="https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/operators/floor_division.html">"floor division"</a> to return just the integer (integral part) of 2, discarding the remainder. This can be useful to <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/geekculture/solving-a-respectable-codility-challenge-in-one-line-of-code-6c331deff8bb">efficiently solve</a> the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/count_div/">"Prefix Sums CountDiv" coding interview challenge</a>: "Write a function … that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K":

   <pre>def solution(a, b, k):
    return 0 if b == 0 else int(b // k - (a - 1) // k)
   </pre>

Instead of a "brute force" approach which has linear time complexity — O(n), the solution using floor division is constant time - O(1).


<a name="Modulo"></a>

### Modulo operator

<tt>11 % 5</tt> uses the (percent sign), the <strong>modulo operator</strong> to divide 11 by the quotient 5 in order to return 1 because two 5s can go into 11, leaving 1 left over, the remainder.
Modulus is used in circular buffers and hashing algorithms.

```
def solution(A, K):
    # A is the array.
    # K is the increment to move.
    result = [None] * len(A)   # initialize result array for # items in array

    for i in range(len(A)):
        # Use % modulo operator to calculate new index position 0 - 9:
        result[(i + K) % len(A)] = A[i]
        print(f'i={i} A[i]={A[i]} K={K} result={result} ')
    return result

print(solution([7, 2, 8, 3, 5], 2))
```

Modulu is also used in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/CodilityInPython/blob/master/solutions/euclideanalgorithm/chocolates_by_numbers.py">this</a>


<hr />

<a name="WhenNow"></a>

## What Day and Time is it?

The ISO 8601 format contains 6-digit microseconds ("123456") and a Time Zone offset ("-5.00" being five hours West of UTC):

   <ul>2025-12-22T07:53:19.123456-05:00</ul>

```
# import datetime
start = datetime.datetime.now()
# do some stuff ...
end = datetime.datetime.now()
elapsed = end - start
print(elapsed)
# or
print(elapsed.seconds,":",elapsed.microseconds)
```

Some prefer to display local time with a Time Zone code from Python package pytz or zulu.

PROTIP: Servers within enterprises and military run in UTC time and Logs should be output in UTC time
rather than local time,

   <ul>2024-02-22T12:53:19.123456</ul>

<tt><strong>datetime.datetime.now()</strong></tt> provides <strong>microsecond</strong> precision:

References:
   * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-current-time-in-different-timezone-using-python/


### Timezone handling

During Debian OS 12 install from iso file, a time zone is requested to be manually selected.
After boot-up:
1. Check the current timezone with bash <tt>timedatectl</tt>
1. Set the timezone to UTC with bash <tt>sudo timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC</tt>
Alternately, reconfigure the timezone data with bash <tt>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</tt>
then select "None of the above" from the Continents list, then select "UTC" from the second list:
Follow the prompts to navigate through the menus and select Etc or None of the above, then choose UTC.

NOTE: On macOS, timezone data are in a binary file at <tt>/etc/localtime</tt>.

Within Python, there are several ways to detect time zone:

```
from dateutil import tz

local_timezone = tz.tzlocal()
print("dateutil local_timezone=",local_timezone)
```


Use the dateutil library to read /etc/localtime and get the timezone-aware datetime object:
```
from datetime import datetime

local_now = datetime.now().astimezone()
local_timezone = local_now.tzinfo
print("zoneinfo local_timezone=",local_timezone)
```

```
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
from datetime import datetime

local_timezone = datetime.now(ZoneInfo("localtime")).tzinfo
print("zoneinfo local_timezone=",local_timezone)
```

Use the tzlocal library to obtain the IANA time zone name (e.g., 'America/New_York').
But it varies across operating systems.
```
import tzlocal
local_timezone = tzlocal.get_localzone_name()
print("tzlocal local_timezone=",local_timezone)
```

Once a datetime has a tzinfo, the astimezone() strategy supplants new tzinfo
```
# astimezone() defaults to the local time zone when no argument is provided.
from datetime import datetime

local_now = datetime.now().astimezone()
local_timezone = local_now.tzinfo
print("astimezone local_timezone=",local_timezone)
```

### Timing Attacks

A malicious use of precise microseconds timing code is used by <a target="_blank" href="https://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/">Timing Attacks</a> based on the time it takes for an application to authenticate a password to determine the algorithm used to process the password. In the case of <a target="_blank" href="http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/">Keyczar vulnerability found by Nate Lawson</a>, a simple break-on-inequality algorithm was used to compare a candidate HMAC digest with the calculated digest. A value which shares no bytes in common with the secret digest returns immediately; a value which shares the first 15 bytes will return 15 compares later.

Similarly, <a target="_blank" href="https://belitsoft.com/assets/python-security.pdf">PDF: entropy</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/146260721-42584e8b-25d4-4853-a073-295dbbd9ac24.png">

PROTIP: Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.compare_digest">secrets.compare_digest module</a> (introduced in Python 3.5) to check passwords and other private values. It uses a <strong>constant amount of time</strong> to process every request.

Functions hmac.compare_digest() and secrets.compare_digest() are designed to mitigate against timing attacks.

<a name="DurationCalcs"></a>

## Run Duration calculations

Several packages, functions, and methods are available. They differ by:
   * the type of duration they report: wall-clock time or CPU time
   * how they treat time zone changes during the recording period
   * how much <strong>precision</strong> they report (down to microseconds)
   <br /><br />

* <strong>Wall-clock time</strong> (aka clock time or wall time) is the total time <strong>elapsed</strong> you can measure with a stopwatch. It is the difference between the time at which a program finished its execution and the time at which the program started. It <strong>includes waiting time</strong> for resources.

* <strong>CPU Time</strong> is how much time the CPU was <strong>busy processing</strong> programming instructions, not including time waiting for other task to complete (like I/O operations).

We want both reported.

timeit.default_timer() is time.perf_counter() on Python 3.3+.

The same program run several times would report similar CPU time but varying wall-clock times due to differences in what else was taking up resources during the runs.

* time.time() returns wall-clock time.
* time.process_time() returns CPU execution time.

To time the difference between calculation strategies, new since Python 3.7 is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0564/">PEP 564</a>.

<tt><strong>time.perf_counter()</strong></tt> (abbreviation of performance counter) measures the elapsed time of short duration because it returns 82 nano-second resolution on Fedora 4.12. It is based on <strong>Wall-Clock Time</strong> which includes time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter

<tt><strong>time.clock</strong></tt> is no longer available since Python 3.8.

<tt><strong>time.time()</strong></tt> has a resolution of <strong>whole seconds</strong>. And in a measurement period  between start and stop times, if the system time is disrupted (such as for daylight savings) its counting is disrupted. time.time() resolution will only become larger (worse) as years pass since every day adds 86,400,000,000,000 nanoseconds to the system clock, which increases the precision loss. It is called "non-monotonic" because falling back on daylight savings would cause it to report time going backwards:

<ul><pre>start_time = time.time()
# your code
e = time.time() - start_time
time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.gmtime(e))  # for hours:minutes:seconds
print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(e // 3600, (e % 3600 // 60), e % 60))
</pre>
</ul>


### timeit()

For more accurate wall-time capture, the timeit() functions disable the garbage collector.

<tt><strong>timeit.timer()</strong></tt>
provides a nice output format of <tt>0:00:01.946339</tt> for almost 2 seconds.
   * https://pynative.com/python-get-execution-time-of-program/
   * https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html
   * https://www.guru99.com/timeit-python-examples.html
   <br /><br />

<ul><pre>import timeit   # built-in
# print addition of first 1 million numbers
def addition():
    print('Addition:', sum(range(1000000)))
# run same code 5 times to get measurable data
n = 5
# calculate total execution time
result = timeit.timeit(stmt='addition()', globals=globals(), number=n)
# calculate the execution time
# get the average execution time
print(f"Execution time is {result / n} seconds")
</pre></ul>

<pre>timeit.timeit(stmt='pass', setup='pass', timer=&LT;default timer>, number=1000000, globals=None)
</pre>

<ul><pre># from timeit import default_timer as timer
# from datetime import timedelta
start = timer()
# do some stuff ...
end = timer()
print(timedelta(seconds=end-start))
</pre></ul>


<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418">PEP-418</a> in Python 3.3 added three timers:

<tt><strong>time.process_time()</strong></tt> offers 1 nano-second resolution on Linux 4.12. It does not include time during sleep.

<pre>
# import time
t = time.process_time()
# do some stuff ...
elapsed_time = time.process_time() - t
</pre>

<tt><strong>time.monotonic()</strong></tt> is used for measurements on the order of hours/days, when you don't care about sub-second resolution. It has 81 ns resolution on Fedora 4.12. BTW "monotonic" = only goes forward. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.monotonic

### Pickle objects

Pickling is the process of converting (serializing) a (especially complex) Python object (list, dict, set, tuple, matrix) into a byte stream used to transfer to another object, over the internet, or store in a database.

* dump writes result to a file
* load objects from a file

* dumps in-memory object to a file
* loads from file to in-memory objects

### minmax

The difference between API, Library, Package, Module, Script, Frameworks.

A library contains several modules which are separated by its use.

http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html

A module is a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension .py.
Code in a module can be functions, classes, or variables.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o06MyVhYte4">
The most popular imports</a> include system, time, random, datetime, argparse, re (regular expressions), math, xarray, polars (for computation), seaborn (charts with themes) on top of matplatlib, pytorch, pygame, result (exception handling), pydantic (data validation), missingno, sqlmodel (ORM fastapi), beautifulsoup, python-dotenv (key value pairs in environment variables).

Packages can also contain modules and other packages (subpackages).

Packages structure Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”.

The ___ VScode extension squences and reformats import statements to save memory. If the program only needs a single function, only that would be imported in.

Django, Flask, Bottle are frameworks - that provide the basic flow and architecture of the application.

```
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

try:
    celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
    fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
    print(f"{celsius}°C is equal to {fahrenheit:.2f}°F")
    f"{fahrenheit:.2f}"
    round(fahrenheit, 2)
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number for the temperature.")

### Reduce Space Complexity with Dynamic programming

Techniques for calculation of <strong>nested loops</strong> is often used to shown how to reduce run times by using techniques that use more memory space.  Rather than "brute-force" repeatitive computations as in the definition of how to calculate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nki9hhW-tAI&list=PLNmW52ef0uws098xXRbALoadgcc4bNkDm&index=4">Fibonacci numbers</a>, which by definition is based on numbers preceding it.

   <ul><pre>fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)</pre></ul>

Fibonacci has the highest BigO because it uses recursive execution with Python generators. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OSEzdOpmWQ">VIDEO</a>

Memoization  (sounds  like  memorization)  is  the  technique of  writing  a  function  that  remembers  the  results  of  previous computations.

Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

That's a technique of "Dynamic Programming" (See https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dynamic_programming)

Dynamic programming is a catch phrase for solutions based on solving
successively similar but smaller problems, using algorithmic tasks in which
the solution of a bigger problem is relatively easy to find,
if we have solutions for its sub-problems.


## Avoid divide by zero errors

Use this in every division to ensure that a zero denominator results in falling into "else 0" rather than a "ZeroDivisionError" at run-time:

<pre>def weird_division(n, d):
    # n=numerator, d=denominator.
    return n / d if d else 0
</pre>

## Random

Flip a coin:
```
import random

if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
  print("heads!")
else:
  print("tails!")
```

## Environment Variable Cleansing

To read a file named ".env" at the $HOME folder, and obtain the value from "MY_EMAIL":

<pre>import os
env_vars = !cat ~/.env
for var in env_vars:
    key, value = var.split('=')
    os.environ[key] = value
&nbsp;
print(os.environ.get('MY_EMAIL'))   # containing "johndoe@gmail.com"
</pre>

This code is important because it keeps secrets in your $HOME folder, away from folders that get pushed up to GitHub.

There is the "load_dotenv" package that can do the above, but using native commands mean less exposure to potential attacks.

Remember that attackers can use directory traversal sequences (../) to fetch the sensitive files from the server.

Sanitize the user input using “shlex”

## Blob vs. File vs. Text

A "BLOB" (Binary Large OBject) is a data type that stores binary data such as mp4 videos, mp3 audio, pictures, pdf. So usually large -- up to 2 TB (2,147,483,647 characters).

## Movie Recommender

A popular project is to combine from Kagle a historical database of movies and TV shows from several streaming sites:
   * Disney+
   * Netflix
   * Hulu
   * Amazon Prime
   <br /><br />

https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/blob/master/movie_recs/movie_recommendations.ipynb
https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip

My rudimentry show-recommendations.py makes recommendations based on identifying atrributes of a single movie and showing others with the same attributes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEabQRBMQA

It uses imports numpy and pandas for data handling.

Another advancement is to use the <strong>SurPRISE library</strong> (https://surpriselib.com/), named from the acronym Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4BCDukdNU">VIDEO</a>

```
surprise -h
```

A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.0 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.


An advancement is Movielens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
The load_builtin() method will offer to download the movielens-100k dataset if it has not already been downloaded, and it will save it in the .surprise_data folder in your home directory (you can also choose to save it somewhere else).



Surprise is a "scikit" (https://projects.scipy.org/scikits.html)
which enables you to <a target="_blank" href="https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/building_custom_algo.html">build your own cross-validation recommendation algorithm</a> as well as use ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as:
   * baseline algorithms,
   * neighborhood methods,
   * similarity measures (cosine,

Matrix factorization-based algorithms are used for collaborative filtering within recommender systems. The algorithms aim decompose a large user-item interaction matrix into smaller matrices that capture latent factors. The four common matrix factorization algorithms are SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF:

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) decomposes the user-item matrix into three  lower-dimensional matrices:

   * U to represent user factors
   * V^T to represent item factors
   * Σ to contain singular values

   When applied to collaborative filtering, SVD aims to minimize the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual ratings for observed entries in the rating matrix.

   QUESTION: The prediction for a user-item pair is calculated as: r̂ui = μ + bu + bi + qi^T * pu Where μ is the overall mean rating, bu and bi are user and item biases, and qi and pu are item and user factor vectors.

SVD++ extends SVD to incorporate both implicit and explicit ratings and implicit feedback (e.g., which items a user has rated). The prediction formula for SVD++ is:

   r̂ui = μ + bu + bi + qi^T * (pu + |N(u)|^(-1/2) * Σj∈N(u)yj) Where N(u) represents the set of items rated by user u, and yj are item factors that capture implicit feedback.

PMF (Probabilistic Matrix Factorization) is a model-based technique that assumes ratings are generated from a Gaussian (normal) distribution. So it factorizes the user-item matrix R into two lower-dimensional matrices: U (user factors) and V (item factors). PMF is particularly effective for large, sparse datasets and scales linearly with the number of observations.

NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) factorizes a non-negative matrix V into two non-negative matrices W and H

   V ≈ W * H^T Where V is the user-item rating matrix, W represents user factors, and H represents item factors. The non-negativity constraint in NMF often leads to more interpretable and sparse decompositions compared to other techniques. Key advantages of NMF include:

    Reduced prediction errors compared to techniques like SVD when non-negativity is imposed

Ability to work with compressed dimensional models, speeding up clustering and data organization Automatic extraction of sparse and significant features from non-negative data vectors

These matrix factorization algorithms have proven to be effective in capturing latent factors and similarities between users and items, making them powerful tools for building recommender systems. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as dataset characteristics, computational resources, and desired interpretability of the results.

To evaluate the performance of regression models and recommender systemsusing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

```
Evaluating RMSE, MAE of algorithm SVD on 5 split(s).
&nbsp;
            Fold 1  Fold 2  Fold 3  Fold 4  Fold 5  Mean    Std
RMSE        0.9311  0.9370  0.9320  0.9317  0.9391  0.9342  0.0032
MAE         0.7350  0.7375  0.7341  0.7342  0.7375  0.7357  0.0015
Fit time    6.53    7.11    7.23    7.15    3.99    6.40    1.23
Test time   0.26    0.26    0.25    0.15    0.13    0.21    0.06
```

Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate better predictive accuracy.

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is calculated as the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. It gives higher weight to larger errors, making it more sensitive to outliers. The formula for RMSE is:

   RMSE = √(Σ(predicted - actual)^2 / n)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. The formula for MAE is:

   MAE = Σ|predicted - actual| / n

RMSE is more sensitive to large errors, while
MAE provides a more intuitive measure of average error magnitude.

### Handle Strings safely

Python has four different ways to format strings.

Using f-strings to format (potentially malicious) <a target="_blank" href="https://snyk.io/blog/python-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet/">user-supplied strings can be exploited</a>:

```
from string import Template
greeting_template = Template("Hello World, my name is $name.")
greeting = greeting_template.substitute(name="Hayley")
```

So use a way that's less flexible with types and doesn’t evaluate Python statements.

### Data Types

In Python 2, there was an internal limit to how large an integer value could be: 2^63 - 1.

But that limit was removed in Python 3. So there now is no explicitly defined limit, but the amount of available address space forms a practical limit depending on the machine Python runs on. 64-bit

<tt>0xa5</tt> (two character bits) represents a hexdidecimal number

<tt>3.2e-12</tt> expresses as a a constant exponential value.

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">
list methods</a>

### Slicing strings

For flexibility with alternative languages such as Cyrillic (Russian) character set,
return just the first 3 characters of a string:

   <pre>letters = "abcdef"
first_part = letters[:3]
   </pre>

## Unicode Superscript & Subscript characters

<pre># Specify Unicode characters:
# superscript
print("x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 2")  # x² + y² = 2
&nbsp;
# subscript
print(u'H\u2082SO\u2084')  # H₂SO₄
</pre>

### Superscript

<pre># super-sub-script.py converts to superscript:
def conv_superscript(x):
    normal = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+-=()"
    super_s = "ᴬᴮᶜᴰᴱᶠᴳᴴᴵᴶᴷᴸᴹᴺᴼᴾᴾᴿˢᵀᵁⱽᵂˣʸᶻᵃᵇᶜᵈᵉᶠᵍʰᶦʲᵏˡᵐⁿᵒᵖ۹ʳˢᵗᵘᵛʷˣʸᶻ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁺⁻⁼⁽⁾"
    res = x.maketrans(''.join(normal), ''.join(super_s))
    return x.translate(res)
&nbsp;
print(conv_superscript('Convert all this2'))

## Internationalization & Localization (I18N & L18N)

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://lokalise.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-python-i18n/">BLOG</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z45ZFCLqx70">VIDEO: Internationalization and localization in Web Applications</a> by James Cutajar
   <br /><br />

Internationalization, aka i18n for the 18 characters between i and n, is the process of adapting coding to support various linguistic and cultural settings:

   * date and time zone calculations
   * numbers and currency
   * Pluralization
   <br /><br />

1. Install

   <pre>pip install gettext</pre>

   NOTE: pip is a recursive acronym that stands for either "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python".

1. Create a folder for each locale in the <tt>./locale</tt> folder.

1. Use Lokalise utility to manage translations through a GUI. It also has a CLI tool to automate the process of managing translations.  https://lokalise.com/blog/lokalise-apiv2-in-practice/

   ```
   locales/
├── el
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── base.po
└── en
    └── LC_MESSAGES
        └── base.po
   ```

1. Add the library

   ```
   import gettext
# Set the local directory
localedir = './locale'
# Set up your magic function
translate = gettext.translation('appname', localedir, fallback=True)
_ = translate.gettext
# Translate message
print(_("Hello World"))
   ```

   See https://phrase.com/blog/posts/translate-python-gnu-gettext/

1. Store a master list of locales supported in a Portable Object Template (POT) file, also known as a translator:

   ```
   #: src/main.py:12
msgid "Hello World"
msgstr "Translation in different language"
   ```


   ```
   >>> unicode_string = u"Fuu00dfbu00e4lle"
>>> unicode_string
Fußbälle
>>> type(unicode_string)
&LT;type 'unicode'>
>>> utf8_string = unicode_string.encode("utf-8")
>>> utf8_string
'Fuxc3x9fbxc3xa4lle'
>>> type(utf8_string)
&LT;type 'str'>
   ```

```

# format_date(d, locale='en')     # u'Apr 1, 2007'
# format_date(d, locale='de_DE')  # u'01.04.2007'
```

### Switch language in browsers

Ensure that your program works correctly when another human language (such as "es" for Spanish, "ko" for Korean, "de" for German, etc.) is configured by the user:

   A. English was selected in browser's Preferences, but the app displays another language.

   B. Another language was selected in browser's preferences, and the app displays that language.

To simulate selecting another language in the browser's Preferences in Firefox:

<pre>FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions();
options.addPreference("intl.accept_languages", language);
driver = new FirefoxDriver(options);
</pre>

Alternately, in Chrome:

<pre>HashMap&LT;String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap&LT;String, Object>();
chromePrefs.put("intl.accept_languages", language);
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", chromePrefs);
driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
</pre>

## Version management

1. To create a requirements.txt file containing the latest versions:

   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

1. Identify whether CVEs have been filed against each module in requirements.txt:

   ```
   sbom ???
   ```

 If you’re writing a library that you intend to distribute and use in many places (or to be used by many people), the standard approach is to write a setup.py package manifest, and in the install_requires argument of setup() declare your dependencies. You should declare only direct dependencies, and declare the range of versions your library is compatible with.

If you’ve built something that you want to deploy, or otherwise reproduce as an environment somewhere else, the standard approach is to create a requirements file containing the full (direct and transitive) dependency tree, pinned to exact versions, with package hashes included. You can do this by writing a script that strings together several pip commands, or by using the pre-made “pip-compile” script from the pip-tools project.

This pyproject.toml file will work with modern versions of setuptools (61.0 and above). It replaces the need for a separate setup.py or setup.cfg file in many cases. However, if you need more complex build configurations or have custom build steps, you may still need to use a setup.py file alongside pyproject.toml.

Remember to adjust the content according to your specific project requirements. The pyproject.toml file is designed to be human-readable and writable, making it easier to manage your project's metadata and build configuration.

PROTIP: I've found Poetry to be difficult to debug https://install.python-poetry.org:

   ```
   brew install poetry
   ```

1. Verify:

   ```
   poetry --version
   ```
   Expected response like:
   ```
   Poetry (version 1.8.3)
   ```

1. Initialize to be prompted to create a pyproject.toml file:

   ```
   poetry init
   ```

1. Run based on the pyproject.toml

   ```
   poetry add requests --no-interaction
   poetry update requests
   ```

1. Run based on the pyproject.toml

   ```
   poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
   ```

   Instead of

   ```
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
   ```

### Excel handling using Dictionary object

Alternately, the <a target="_blank" href="https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_cell_notation.html#cell-utility">Python library to work with Excel spreadsheets</a> translates between Excel cell addresses (such as "A1") and zero-based Python array tuple:

<pre>str = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 0, row_abs=True, col_abs=True)  # $A$1
(row, col) = xl_cell_to_rowcol('A1')    # (0, 0)
column = xl_col_to_name(1, True)   # $B
</pre>

However, if you want to avoid adding a dependency,
this function defines a dictionary to convert an Excel column number to a number:<a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4528982/convert-alphabet-letters-to-number-in-python">*</a>

<pre>def letter_to_number(letters):
    letters = letters.lower()
    dictionary = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4,'e':5,'f':6,'g':7,'h':8,'i':9,'j':10,'k':11,'l':12,'m':13,'n':14,'o':15,'p':16,'q':17,'r':18,'s':19,'t':20,'u':21,'v':22,'w':23,'x':24,'y':25,'z':26}
    strlen = len(letters)
    if strlen == 1:
        number = dictionary[letters]
    elif strlen == 2:
        first_letter = letters[0]
        first_number = dictionary[first_letter]
        second_letter = letters[1]
        second_number = dictionary[second_letter]
        number = (first_number * 26) + second_number
    elif strlen == 3:
        first_letter = letters[0]
        first_number = dictionary[first_letter]
        second_letter = letters[1]
        second_number = dictionary[second_letter]
        third_letter = letters[2]
        third_number = dictionary[third_letter]
        number = (first_number * 26 * 26) + (second_number * 26) + third_number
    return number
</pre>

REMEMBER: Square brackets are used to reference by value.

Instead of defining a dictionary, you can use a property of the ASCII character set, in that the Latin alphabet begins from its 65th position for "A" and its 97th character for "a", obtained using the ordinal function:

<pre>ord('a')  # returns 97
ord('A')  # returns 65</pre>

This returns 'a' :

<pre>chr(97)</pre>

### More dictionaries:

<pre># Eastern European countries: SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier
ee_countries={"Ukraine": "43.7M", "Russia": "143.8M", "Poland": "38.1M", "Romania": "19.5M", "Bulgaria": "6.9M", "Hungary": "9.6M", "Moldova": "4.1M"}
float(ee_countries["Moldova"].rstrip("M"))  # 4.1
ee_countries.get("Moldova")   # 4.1M
len(ee_countries.items())     # 7 are immutable in dictionary

## File open() modes

The Python runtime does not enforce type annotations introduced with Python version 3.5. But type checkers, IDEs, linters, SASTs, and other tools can benefit from the developer being more explicit.

Use this type checker to discover when the parameter is outside the allowed set and warn you:

<pre>MODE = Literal['r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb']
def open_helper(file: str, mode: MODE) -> str:
    ...
    open_helper('/some/path', 'r')  # Passes type check
    open_helper('/other/path', 'typo')  # Error in type checker
</pre>

BTW Literal[…] was introduced with version 3.8 and is not enforced by the runtime (you can pass whatever string you want in our example).

PROTIP: Be explicit about using text (vs. binary) mode.

<pre>with open("D:\\myfile.txt", "w") as myfile:
    myfile.write("Hello")
</pre>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="bottom"><th>Character</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>b</td><td>binary (text mode is default)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>t</td><td>text mode (default)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>r</td><td>read-only (the default)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>+</td><td>open for updating (read and write)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>w</td><td>write-only after truncating the file</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>a</td><td>append</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>a+</td><td>opens a file for both appending and reading at the same time</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>x</td><td>open for exclusive creation, failing if file already exists</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>U</td><td>universal newlines mode (used to upgrade older code)</td></tr>
</table>

<strong>myfile.write()</strong> returns the count of <strong>codepoints</strong> (characters in the string), not the number of bytes.

<strong>myfile.read(3)</strong> returns 3 line endings (\n) in string lines.

<strong>myfile.readlines()</strong> returns a list where each element of the list is a line in the file.

<strong>myfile.truncate(12)</strong> keeps the first 12 characters in the file and deletes the remainder of the file.

<strong>myfile.close()</strong> to save changes.

<strong>myfile.tell()</strong>  tells the current position of the cursor.

See https://docs.python.org/3/library/filesys.html

<a name="FileMetadata"></a>

### File Metadata

Metadata includes Last modified and Last accessed info (mtime and atime).
Such information is maintained at the folder level.

For all commands, if the destination location is not writable, an IOError exception is raised.

<a name="shutil.copyfile"></a>

* To copy a file <strong>within the same folder</strong> as the source file:

   <pre><strong>shutil.copyfile(src, dst)</strong></pre>

   buffer cannot be when copying to another folder.

* To copy a file within the same folder and <strong>buffer</strong> file-like objects (with a read or write method, such as StringIO):

   <pre><strong>shutil.copyfileobj(src, dst)</strong></pre>

Notice both individual file copy commands do not copy over permissions from the source file.
Both folder-level copy commands below carry over permissions.

CAUTION: folder-level copy commands do not buffer.

* PROTIP: To copy a file to another folder and <strong>retain metadata</strong>:

   <pre><strong>file_src = 'source.txt'
f_src = open(file_src, 'rb')
file_dest = 'destination.txt'
f_dest = open(file_dest, 'wb')
shutil.copyfileobj(f_src, f_dest)
   </strong></pre>

   The destination needs to specify a <strong>full path</strong>.

* To copy a file to another folder and <strong>NOT retain <a href="#FileMetadata">metadata</a></strong>:

   <pre><strong>shutil.copy2(src, "/usr", *, follow_symlinks=True)</strong></pre>

* You can use the operating system shell copy command, but there is the overhead of opening a pipe, system shell, or subprocess, plus poses a potential security risk.

   <pre><strong># In Unix/Linux
os.system('cp source.txt destination.txt')  \# https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system
status = subprocess.call('cp source.txt destination.txt', shell=True)
&nbsp;
# In Windows
os.system('copy source.txt destination.txt')
status = subprocess.call('copy source.txt destination.txt', shell=True)  \# https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
</strong></pre>

* Pipe open has been deprecated. https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen

   <pre><strong># In Unix/Linux
os.popen('cp source.txt destination.txt')
&nbsp;
# In Windows
os.popen('copy source.txt destination.txt')
</strong></pre>


## Error Exception handling

Handle file not found exception <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=42650a6d-6632-4ae7-8b4f-88fa80ce6633">:</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=23a27b06-78be-41d9-82d7-eb73fb4f414f">:</a>

<pre># if file doesn't exist in folder, create it:
import os
import sys
&nbsp;
def make_at(path p, dir_name)
    original_path = os.getcwd()
    try:
        os.chdir(path)
        os.makedir(dir_name)
    except OSError as e:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
        raise
    finally:  #clean-up no matter what:
        os.chdir(original_path)</pre>

## Operating system

There are platform-specific modules<a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=a2b5fcba-79c7-4602-9de2-dd84a46033d">:</a>

   * Windows msvcrt (Visual C run-time)
   * MacOS sys, tty, termios, etc.
   <br /><br />

To determine what operating system to wait for a keypress,
use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.system">sys.platform</a>, which has finer granularity than sys.name because it uses uname<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.platform">:</a>

   <ul><pre># https://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.platform
from sys import platform
if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":
    # linux
elif platform == "darwin":
    # MacOS
elif platform == "win32":
    # Windows
elif platform == "cygwin":
    # Windows running cygwin Linux emulator
   </pre></ul>

http://code.google.com/p/psutil/
to do more in-depth research.


PROTIP: This is an example of Python code issuing a Linux operating system command:

<pre>if run("which python3").find("venv") == -1:
    # something when not executed from venv
</pre>

<a target="_blank" href="https://belitsoft.com/assets/python-security.pdf">SECURITY PROTIP</a>: Avoid using the built-in Python function "eval" to execute a string. There are no controls to that operation, allowing malicious code to be executed without limits in the context of the user that loaded the interpreter (really dangerous):

   <ul><pre>import sys
import os
try:
    eval("__import__('os').system('clear')", {})
    #eval("__import__('os').system(cls')", {})
    print "Module OS loaded by eval"
except Exception as e:
    print repr(e)
   </pre></ul>



## Command generator

Create custom CLI commands by parsing a command help text into cli code that implements it.

Brilliant.

See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/docopt/docopt">
docopt from https://github.com/docopt/docopt</a> described at <a target="_blank" href="http://docopt.org/">http://docopt.org</a>

## CLI code enhancement

Python's built-in mechinism for coding Command-line menus, etc. is difficult to understand.
So some have offered alternatives:

* <a target="_blank" href="http://builtoncement.com/">cement</a> - CLI Application Framework for Python.
* <a target="_blank" href="http://click.pocoo.org/dev/">click</a> - A package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.openstack.org/developer/cliff/">cliff</a> - A framework for creating command-line programs with multi-level commands.
* <a target="_blank" href="http://docopt.org/">docopt</a> - Pythonic command line arguments parser.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/python-fire">python-fire</a> - A library for creating command line interfaces from absolutely any Python object.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit">python-prompt-toolkit</a> - A library for building powerful interactive command lines.


## Handling Arguments

For parsing parameters supplied by invoking a Python program,
the command-line arguments and options/flags:

   <ul>python myprogram.py -v -LOG=info
   </ul>

The <strong>argparse</strong> package comes with Python 3.2+ (and the optparse package that comes with Python 2), it's difficult to understand and limited in functionality.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/argparse-vs-docopt-vs-click-comparing-python-command-line-parsing-libraries/

Alternatives: to Argparse are Docopt, Click, Client, <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/argh/">argh</a>, and many more.

Instead, <a target="_blank" href="https://dbader.org/blog/python-commandline-tools-with-click">
Dan Bader recommends</a> the use of
<a target="_blank" href="http://click.pocoo.org/6/why/">click.pocoo.org/6/why</a>
click custom package (from Armin Ronacher).

Click is a Command Line Interface Creation Kit for arbitrary nesting of commands, automatic help page generation. It supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime. It comes with common helpers (getting terminal dimensions, ANSI colors, fetching direct keyboard input, screen clearing, finding config paths, launching apps and editors, etc.)

Click provides <strong>decorators</strong> which makes reading of code very easy.

The "@click.command()" :

   <pre>\# cli.py
import click
&nbsp;
@click.command()
def main():
    print("I'm a beautiful CLI ✨")
&nbsp;
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
   </pre>

<a name="Lists"></a>

## Lists

Use a list instead for a collection of similar objects.

<a target="_blank" href="https://python.plainenglish.io/python-probably-more-than-90-of-coders-are-missing-this-easy-trick-1f5e1c2d8561">
Prefix what to print with an asterisk</a> so it is passed as separate values so a space is added in between each value.

<pre>li = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
li = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(*li)
</pre>

## Tuples

Values are passed to a function with a single variable.
So to multiple values of various types to or from a function, we use a
<strong>tuple</strong> - a fixed-sized collection of related items (akin to a "struct" in Java or "record").

PROTIP: When adding a single value, include a comma at the end to avoid it being classified as a string:


1. REMEMBER: When storing a single value in a Tuple, the comma at the end makes it not be classified as a string:

   <pre>mytuple=(50,)
type(mytuple)
   </pre>

   <pre>&LT;class 'tuple'></pre>

1. Store several items in a single variable:

   <pre>person = ('john', 'doe', 40)
(a, b, c) = person
person
a
person[0::2]  # every 2 from 2nd item  =  ('john', 40)
person.index(40)  # index of item containing 40 = 2
   </pre>

## Range

myrange  # range(0, 3)
print(myrange)  # range(0, 3)
list(myrange)   # [0, 1, 2] from zero
myrange=range(1,5)
list(myrange)   # [1, 2, 3, 4] # excluding 5!
myrange=range(3,15,2)
list(myrange)         # [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]  # skip every 2
list(myrange)[2]      # 7
print( range(5,15,4)[::-1] )  # range(13, 1, -4)
   </pre>

   &LT;class 'range'>


## List comprehension

<pre><strong>squares = [x * x for x in range(10)]
</strong></pre>

would output:
<pre>[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]</pre>

Encapsulation is a software design practice of bundling the data and the methods that operate on that data.

Methods encode behavior (programmed logic) of an object and are represented by functions.

Attributes encode the state of an object and are represented by variables.

   * <strong>L</strong>ocal - Inside the current function
   * <strong>E</strong>nclosing - Inside enclosing functions
   * <strong>G</strong>lobal - At the top level of the module

Decorators allow changes in behavior without changing the code.

Decorators take advantage of Python being live dynamically compiled.

There are limitations, though.

By default, functions within a class need to supply "self" as the first parameter.

   <ul><pre>class MyClass:
   attribute = "class attribute"
   ...
   def afunction(self,text_in):
       cls.attribute = text_in
   </pre></ul>

<a target="_blank" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=d7eb69f7-37d3-4893-8773-79e73642064b">VIDEO</a>:
However, decorator <tt><strong>@classmethod</strong></tt> enable "cls" to be accepted as the first argument:

   <ul><pre>def afunction(self,text_in):
       cls.attribute = text_in
   </pre></ul>

   The @classmethod is used for access to the class object to call other class methods or the constuctor.

There is also <tt><strong>@staticmethod</strong></tt> when access is not needed to class or instance objects.

### dunders with Context Manager

> "For repetitive set up and tear down, use Context Managers". -<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spi0N_PNznE&t=2m23s">VIDEO by Doug Mercer</a>

When a client is used in Python code, it must be closed as well.
Context manager is a language feature of Python that takes care of things when you enter and exit the context.
```
with open("myfile.txt", r) as f:
    contents = f.read()
```
double underscores ("dunders") before and after each name.
__enter__, __exit__,<br />
__init__, __repr__, __len__, __hash__, __add__, __sub__,<br />
__and__, __reversed__, __contains__, __format__, __iter__, __call__,<br />

Magic methods getitem, len, etc. make you code look like it's part of the library.

Make it Iterable.

<a name="Logging"></a>

## Logging for Monitoring

   * https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.6/Lib/logging
   * https://realpython.com/python-logging-source-code/
   * https://infosecwriteups.com/most-common-python-vulnerabilities-and-how-to-avoid-them-5bbd22e2c360
   * https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/python-logging-basics/">
   <br /><br />

It is estimated that it can take up to 200 days, and often longer, between attack and detection by the attacked.
In the meantime, attackers can tamper with servers, corrupt databases, and steal confidential information.

"Insufficient Logging and Monitoring" is among the top 10 OWASP.

The vulnerability includes ineffective integration of security systems,
which give attackers a way to pivot to other parts of the system to maintain persistent threats.

Prevent that by emitting a log entry for each activity such as: add, change/update, delete.

Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/python-logging/">Python logging module</a>:

<pre>import logging
</pre>

To emit each log entry, use the loggin method so that logs can be filtered by level. In order of severity:

   <pre>logging.critical("CRITICAL - Can't ... Aborting!") # A serious error. The program itself may be unable to continue running. Displayed even in production runs.
logging.error("ERROR - Program cannot do it!") # A serious problem: the software is not been able to perform some function. Displayed even in production runs.
logging.warning("WARNING - unexpected!")  # The software is still working as expected. But may be a problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’).
logging.info("INFO - version xxx")  # Provides confirmation that things are working as expected.
logging.debug('DEBUG - detailed information such as each iteration in a loop used during troubleshooting at the lowest level of detail.')
   </pre>

At run-time, specify the highest level to display during that run:

   <pre>python3 pylogging.py <strong>--log=INFO</strong>
   </pre>

   * CRITICAL = 50
   * FATAL = CRITICAL
   * ERROR = 40
   * WARNING = 30
   * WARN = WARNING
   * INFO = 20
   * DEBUG = 10
   * NOTSET = 0
   <br /><br />

CRITICAL, FATAL, and ERROR are always shown.

WARN (WARNING) is the default verbosity level.
Set the default:
<ul>
   <pre>logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s - %(message)s', datefmt='%H:%M:%S')
#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,filename='example.log')
</pre>
   </pre>
</ul>

Also, provide a run-time option for outputing to a file:

   <pre>logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', filemode='w', format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   </pre>

CAUTION: Be careful to not disclose sensitive information in logs.
Encrypt plaintext.

The logging module also allows you to capture the full stack traces in an application.


<tt>-q</tt> (for -quiet) suppresses INFO headings.

<tt>-v</tt> (for -verbose) to display DEBUB messages.

<tt>-vv</tt> to display TRACE messages.

PROTIP: By default, python executes with “_debug_” = “true” so asserts are processed by the Python interpreter.
But in production when the program is run in optimized mode, “_debug_” = “true” so assert statements are ignored.

So avoid coding <a target="_blank" href="https://itnext.io/common-python-security-problems-ffedbae7b11c">the sample code below</a> which uses a comma that acts as an if/then:

<pre>def get_clients(user):
    assert is_superuser(user),  # user is not a member of superuser group
    return db.lookup('clients')
</pre>

In the above code, the user ends up with access to a resource with improper authentication controls.

Instead (to remediate), use a if-else logic to implement true and false conditions.

## Stegnography

https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165102/Stegano-0.10.1.html
Stegano implements two methods of hiding: using the red portion of a pixel to hide ASCII messages, and using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It is possible to use a more advanced LSB method based on integers sets. The sets (Sieve of Eratosthenes, Fermat, Carmichael numbers, etc.) are used to select the pixels used to hide the information.

Google style uses indentation to separate sections. The basic structure is:

```python
def function(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): Description of arg1
        arg2 (str): Description of arg2

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: Description of when this error is raised

    Examples:
        Examples should be written in doctest format and should illustrate how
        to use the function.

        >>> function(1, 'test')
        True

1. CPython is the standard and most widely used implementation of the Python programming language. It is both an interpreter and a compiler, providing a solid balance between performance and ease of use. CPython translates Python code into bytecode before executing it, which allows for excellent integration with C extensions and libraries.

1. Pyston is a fork of CPython, with additional optimizations primarily aimed at improving the performance of large applications. It uses JIT techniques similar to PyPy but focuses on maintaining maximal compatibility with CPython.

1. Nuitka is a Python-to-C++ compiler that translates Python code into optimized C++ executables. It can significantly improve the performance of Python applications by generating faster code while maintaining compatibility with the vast majority of Python libraries.

1. PyPy is renowned for its performance improvements over CPython, thanks to its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. It aims to execute Python code faster by dynamically compiling Python bytecodes to machine code at runtime. PyPy is particularly effective for long-running processes due to its optimization capabilities.

1. Jython compiles Python code to Java bytecode, allowing Python programs to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes it a great choice for integrating Python with Java, accessing Java frameworks, and using Java libraries in Python programs.

1. IronPython is tailored for compatibility with the .NET Framework, compiling Python code to .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL). It enables developers to use Python scripts and libraries within the .NET framework and access .NET functionalities directly.

1. MicroPython is designed for use in microcontrollers and in constrained environments. It implements a subset of Python standards and includes specific libraries to optimize Python code to run on hardware with limited resources like RAM and processing power.

1. Brython (Browser Python) is an implementation of Python 3 for client-side web programming via a JavaScript framework. It allows Python code to run in browsers, utilizing web APIs as seamlessly as JavaScript.

1. Stackless Python enhances Python with support for microthreads, allowing for concurrent programming without traditional thread-related overhead. It's particularly useful for applications requiring a large number of simultaneously active tasks, like game development or network servers.

QUESTION: What coding style would take advantage of compilers or hinder their use?
