{% include l18n.html %}
{% include _toc.html %}

The name "Jupyter" comes from the combination of languages Julia, Python, and R (the statistics package).

{% include whatever.html %}

Jupyter is a <strong>web application server</strong> that runs several 
separate environments (one on each port). It's open-sourced at:
<ul><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git">https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git</a></ul>

Each Jupyter notebook contains explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations 
all in one easily <strong>sharable</strong> document.

Jupyter Notebooks are JSON files with the extension <strong>.ipynb</strong>. However, ".txt" is added for storage.

Notebooks used to be called "iPython" notebooks before languages other than Python were added.

Below is a guided learning experience.
You perform actions in a planned sequence that takes you through various features.
"PROTIP" tags commentary to highlight ideas probably unique to this website.ÃŸ

## Google Colab (Colaboratory)

Google provides a FREE on-line environment with zero configuration:

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com">https://colab.research.google.com</a>

<img width="1436" height="1216" alt="python-colab-welcome-1436x1216" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136654704-a53200b7-32d7-475d-9964-6dba7a3ecf85.png">

In the above example, data is received from the numpy (np) library's random function, rounded down.


### Photo Style Transfer

There are other tools that do this.
But as a practical example of learning about Colab for programming Python Machine Learning, 
let's do a "style transfer" on a photo file <strong>you provide</strong>:

1. Click on this link to open the "TF-Hub: Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles.ipynb" within Colab:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb</a>

   ```
   import tensorflow as tf
   import tensorflow_hub as hub
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   import PIL.Image
   &nbsp;
   def load_img(path_to_img):
   max_dim = 512
   img = tf.io.read_file(path_to_img)
   img = tf.image.decode_image(img, channels=3)
   img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32)
   &nbsp;
   shape = tf.cast(tf.shape(img)[:-1], tf.float32)
   long_dim = max(shape)
   scale = max_dim / long_dim
   &nbsp;
   new_shape = tf.cast(shape * scale, tf.int32)
   &nbsp;
   img = tf.image.resize(img, new_shape)
   img = img[tf.newaxis, :]
   return img
   &nbsp;
   def imshow(image, title=None):
   if len(image.shape) > 3:
      image = tf.squeeze(image, axis=0)
   &nbsp;
   plt.imshow(image)
   if title:
      plt.title(title)
   &nbsp;
   def tensor_to_image(tensor):
   tensor = tensor*255
   tensor = np.array(tensor, dtype=np.uint8)
   if np.ndim(tensor)>3:
      assert tensor.shape[0] == 1
      tensor = tensor[0]
   return PIL.Image.fromarray(tensor)    
   ```

1. To <strong>Run all</strong> Notebook cells: on a Mac, hold down command + fn to press the "F9".

   For a reminder of that keyboard sequence, click the "Runtime" menu.

1. Press (command+down arrow) to scroll down to the bottom to see the default original, style image, and stylized image:

   ![python-style-transfer-1178x410](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136674720-b24e8620-04e8-4d50-bf01-2e6ac002f70f.png)

1. Scroll down past the list of style images and click on each URL to view them.

   The program creates a stylized image for each entry in the "content_url" dictionary.

1. Click the content_name: <strong>sea_turtle</strong> to select another original image.
1. Click the style_name: <strong>munch_scream</strong> to select another style image.

   ### Style Transfer your picture's URL

1. To run the code block:
   * click on the rounded arrow or 
   * Press the Tab key then hold down Shift key to press Return.
   <br /><br />

1. At the left menu, click "To Run: Load more images" to see where you can add a statement pointing to your own photo.

1. Click on this URL, to go to many websites go to get a URL of a photo based on an email:
   
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.gravatar.com/">en.gravatar.com</a>
   
1. Sign in using your WordPress email and password, or sign up and download your photo.
1. Right-click on the picture you want to use and select <strong>Copy image address</strong>.
1. Click on the "TF-Hub" tab to return to the Colab.

1. Replace the "grace_hopper" entry with the URL to your picture, for example:

   <pre>grace_hopper='https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/10217204/6f0736298461c359b864b3939db37f8f.jpg',
   </pre>

1. To <strong>Run all</strong> Notebook cells: on a Mac, hold down command + fn to press the "F9".

1. Select a different style_name and rerun to see a new stylized image.
1. When you see a stylized image you like, right-click on the picture and Save Image As... download.jpg in your Downloads folder:
   
   <img width="1013" alt="jupyter-amadeo-2026x698" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136677101-fcc3dc9c-0620-4bc3-91c6-3146c424bafb.png">

   Admittedly, the pictures are not high resolution.

1. Now edit that picture and share it.

## Browser configuration on your laptop

For possible offline access (on a cruise ship, a railcar through the wilderness, at the beach, etc.):

0. PROTIP: Set Chrome as your default browser.

   REMEMBER: Jupyter's <a href="#CommandPalette">Command Palette</a> does not work in Firefox and Internet Explorer, only in Chrome and Apple Safari.

   ### Jupyter notebook and session files

0. Make a container folder (directory) to hold Jupyter <strong>session files</strong>. 

   This is done automatically by doing a git clone.

0. Download a Jupyter Notebook file into your folder.

   You may have to move downloaded files from your Downloads folder.

   ### Ignore checkpoints on push

0. Edit the <tt>.gitignore</tt> file to add <tt>.ipynb_checkpoints/</tt> so that such folders created automatically are not uploaded into the GitHub repository.

0. <a href="#RunNotebook">run a notebook</a>.

<hr />

## Server Installation

The canonical <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.org/install">https://jupyter.org/install</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html">Installation Guide</a> says
JupyterLab can be <a href="#ManualInsta">manually installed using conda or pip, described below</a>.

However, you will find it easier to use the Docker image defined at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks">https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks</a>. See <a target="_blank" href="
https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html">https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html</a>

Even better, the easiest approach is to use my Bash script at bash/bash-sample.sh

   https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps 

<hr />

<a name="ManualInsta"></a>

### Manual install

0. On a Mac: if you use pipenv, install using that. Otherwise:

   <pre><strong>pip3 install jupyterlab</strong></pre>

   This adds a bunch of "jupyter" files in the <tt>/bin</tt> folder.
   
0. Edit <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> to make sure the <tt>/bin</tt> folder is in the PATH.

   <pre>export PATH="$PATH:/bin"  # for /bin/jupyter</pre>

   One may already be there for other apps.

   <a name="AfterInsta"></a>

   ### After install: Add themes

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes">https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes</a>

   ### Use within VSCode

   Jupyter works great within VSCode.

   See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks



   <a name="StartJupyter"></a>

   ### Start Jupyter server

0. In a Terminal window, enter Jupyter (with & to run in background so you can keep working on the command line):

   <pre><strong>jupyter notebook --port 8888 notebook1.ipynb
   </strong></pre>

   A "&" is added to the end of the command above to run the server in background 
   so that additional bash commands can execute (such as identifying the process number and cleaning up after <a href="#Shutdown">shutdown</a>).

   The command above creates a (hidden) file <strong>.jupyter</strong> in your home folder, invokes a web server locally, and automatically pops up to your default browser a tab with url:

   http://localhost:8888/tree

   Alternately, to start without a web browser:

   <pre>jupyter notebook --no-browser</pre>

   The command response briefly shows a process number:

   <pre>[1] 2809</pre>

   If the command is run again on another Terminal, additional Notebook servers are invoked with the port number incremented from 8888.


   <a name="Shutdown"></a>

   ### Shutdown jupyter server

   If the server was started in background, you can't shutdown the server from Terminal by pressing control + C twice. You would need to run (such as):
   
   <pre><strong>kill -9 2809</strong></pre>

<hr />

<a name="RunNotebook"></a>

## Run Notebook UI

<a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html">
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html</a>

0. If Jupyter was started without specifying a Notebook file, you would see a tree listing.

0. Click a link to a <tt>.ipynb</tt> (Notebook) file listed, to see it's code.

0. PROTIP: You can press the "Run" icon to run a single step. However,
those familiar with the file can press the ">>" button to run all <strong>cells (steps)</strong> in the file.

   Each invocation opens a new browser window.

   <a name="CommandPalette"></a>

   ### Keyboard Command Palette of shortcuts
   
   NOTE: This does not work in Firefox and Internet Explorer,
   only in Chrome and Apple Safari.

0. When in command mode, click the little keyboard icon, 
   called the "command palette". 

   A panel appears with a search bar.

0. Press down arrow to scroll down.

   Keyboard shortcuts are on the right side.

0. Enter a command to search for. 
   Helpful for speeding up your workflow instead of looking around in the menus with your mouse.
