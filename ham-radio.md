The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US, and its equivalent in each country (except Yemen and North Korea) have rules on how its citizens can use the airwaves.

## Goverment & Community bands

The US NIST operates two Short Wave radio stations which broadcast atomic clock times on lower HF:
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-distribution/radio-station-wwv">WWV</a> near Fort Collins, Colorado & WWVH in Hawaii
10 000 W on 5 MHz, 10 MHz, and 15 MHz; and 2500 W on 2.5 MHz and 20 MHz.

NOAA weather service.

Increasingly, Police and Fire use encrypted communications on P25 systems.

Search and Rescue.

Local TV and radio stations

Back in the day, the nickname for someone with amature skills (not professional) was "ham".


## Wireless Tech

Form factors: handheld, mobile, and base station units.

Wireless radio manufacturers create transcivers to operate on specific frequency bands.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUH80LuySQ&t=12s">VIDEO</a>:
Technologies citizens can buy from retail stores (Walmart, Costco, etc.):

* CB (Citizens Band Radio Service) (that truckers using <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Expanded_APCO_10_Codes">10 codes</a>) cannot use repeaters.

* FRS (Family Radio Service) on 22 bands between 462.562250 to 462.72500 MHz 4W up to 25W for 4 miles

* MURS (Multi-Use Radio Service) is limited to 2W on only 5 VHF channels designed for commercial use. The antenna on the BTech MURS-V1 can be replaced. Better out in the open.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs">GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service)</a> adds 8 more channels (at 462-467 MHz) to FRS. <strong>50W max</strong> up to 35 miles = more range and clarity than CB. No-test $35 for 10 year family license. Text & GPS added in 2017.

    * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.repeaterbook.com/gmrs/index.php?state_id=none">U.S. GMRS Repeaters</a>, including all countries not listed above.
    <br /><br />
* Ham/Amateur radio individual operators licensed at the Technician level can build their own equipment.

* Ham/Amateur radio operators licensed at the General level can communicate all over the world on additional frequencies. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/ARRL-General-Class-License-Manual/dp/162595171X/">$29.66 BOOK: AARL manual</a>

* LoRa (Long Range) is a proprietary patented technique to exchange <strong>text messages</strong> (which can include GPS locations) within a low-power but wide-area network (WAN) off cellular networks. It operates only at the <strong>915 MHz</strong> ISM radio band. No license needed. The longest is 150m, but line-of-sight range. Its low power, low bit rate, wireless platform used in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instructables.com/LoRa-Mesh-Radio/">IoT applications</a>. Low bit rate means 0.3 to 50 kbits/s using spread spectrum modulation. [<a target="_blank" href="https://wifivitae.com/2022/12/14/lorawan-mapper-overview/">*</a>]

## Wavelengths vs Frequencies

Light travels at about a constant velocity of 300,000 kilometers per second.<br />
That's 300 Meters per second.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1715686931/ham-wavelengths-1920x1047_e5sbk8.png"><img alt="ham-wavelengths-1920x1047.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1715686931/ham-wavelengths-1920x1047_e5sbk8.png"></a>

To convert between wavelength and frequency for Technician class Ham raio bands:
   * 300 M/sec/ 10 meters ~ 440 MHz
   * 300 M/sec / 2 meters ~ 144 MHz
   * 300 M/sec / 6 meters ~ 50 MHz
   <br /><br />
The 6-meter (50 MHz) band is excellent for meteor scatter communications, when radio waves are reflected back to Earth from the ionized atmospherem where meteorites enter Earth's atmosphere and burning up on entry.



## Maximum PEP Watts:

1,500 Watts is the legal limit on most ham radio bands.

* 1,500 W - EHF (Extremely High Frequency) 30-300 GHz
* 1,500 W - SHF (Super High Frequency) 3-30 GHz
   * 9 cm =  3.300 -  3.500 GHz
   * 5 cm =  5.650 -  5.925 GHz
   * 3 cm = 10.000 - 10.500 GHz
   * 1.2 cm = 24.000 - 24.250 GHz
* 1,500 W - UHF (Ultra High Frequency) 300-3000 MHz 
   * contains spliter frequencies of FRS simplex operation
* 1,500 W - VHF (Very High Frequency) 30-300 MHz
* 200 watts - HF (High Frequency) 3-30 MHz 
   * "shortwave" for very long distance (transcontinental) communication
* 5 watt MF (Medium Frequency) 300-3000 kHz
* 1 watt LF (Low Frequency) 30-300 kHz
<br /><br />

### Shortwave

   * Voice of America: 6.040, 7.335, 15.580 MHz
   * BBC World Service: 5.875, 6.195, 9.410 MHz
   * Radio Havana Cuba: 6.000, 6.165 MHz
   * Radio Romania International: 9.535, 11.940 MHz

   * 120 meter band: 2.3 - 2.495 MHz
   * 90 meter band: 3.2 - 3.4 MHz
   * 75 meter band: 3.9 - 4.0 MHz
   * 60 meter band: 4.75 - 4.995 MHz
   * 49 meter band: 5.9 - 6.2 MHz
   * 41 meter band: 7.2 - 7.45 MHz
   * 31 meter band: 9.4 - 9.9 MHz
   * 25 meter band: 11.6 - 12.2 MHz
   * 22 meter band: 13.57 - 13.87 MHz
   * 19 meter band: 15.1 - 15.8 MHz
   * 16 meter band: 17.48 - 17.9 MHz
   * 13 meter band: 21.45 - 21.85 MHz
   * 11 meter band: 25.67 - 26.1 MHz
   <br /><br />

To get 
want the length of a half-wavelength antenna in inches based on a given wavelength. 

Now that we have our frequency (50 MHz), let's use the tried-and-true formula for a half-wavelength antenna: 468 / frequency in MHz = antenna length in feet. 468 / 50 MHz = 9.36 feet. To convert to inches, take 9.36 feet x 12 = 112.32 inches.

An <strong>antenna analyzer</strong> measures whether an antenna is resonant at the desired operating frequency. It puts out a tiny signal to determine the reactance, impedance, standing wave ratio and resonant frequency of the antenna being evaluated. In some cases it can detect a cable fault in your feed line.


## Modes of modulation
FCC Rule §2.201 on emission types:
* CW (Continuous Wave) = Morse Code
* AM (Amplitude Modulation) upper SSB (Single Side Band) at 2.4 kHz 28.3 - 28.5 MHz (yellow on the chart). 3 Khz without carrier for long range 10 meter
* FM (Frequency Modulation) uses 10-15 kHz bandwidth (2 meters+) vertical polarization. One signal
* PM (Phase Modulation) created by connecting a reactance modulator to a transmitter RF amplier stage.
* FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) is direct digital modulation of oscillator
* FT8 (FSK with 8-tones)
* QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) with four phases shifted to create data bits
* NTSC (National Television System Committee) video UHF analog fast scan 
<br /><br />

in mode U/V, the satellite uplink is in the 70-centimeter band and the downlink is in the 2-meter band.  LEO typically refers to satellites that are 1,000 km to as low as 160 km.

Most VHF power amplifiers are multimode: operate SSB, CW, and FM. 

At frequencies below 29.7 MHz, which includes all HF bands, the maximum bandwidth for a RTTY or data emission is 2.8khz. 

* 20 KHz On 6 meters and 2 meters, max. symbol rate of 19.6k baud.
* 100 KHz on 1.25 meters and 70 cm, max. symbol rate of 5.6k baud.
* No limit on 30 cm and above.
<br /><br />

(most people don't use 6m)

The combination of harmonnic frequencies create spurious output called <strong>intermodulation</strong>.

## Multi-band radio

Retail radios have a short antenna that cannot be swapped out, so are limited to a range of about a mile.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_rhmFntwwc">VIDEO</a>:

https://amzn.to/4asgKrQ It can receive FM Airband, NOAA channels. Can scramble (not encryption).
It contains a GMRS radio and ham radio "mode". Not waterproof. Everytime mode is changed, it resets to factory defaults, wiping out all custom settings. But you can backup and restore via its micro USB connector and low-bit-rate chirp (echolocation like the way dolphins and bats communicate). Hold side button to clone OTW. Hold down 1 to detect nearby frequencies.



## Repeaters

HF reception depends on many factors, such as location, time of year, time of day, the frequency being used, and atmospheric and ionospheric propagation conditions. 

A FM VHF packet repeater is called a digipeater.

## Digital bridge to the internet

Several ways to use digitial technologies with analog voice:

   * VoIP Link
   * Text LoRa Meshtastic
   * WIRES-X
   <br /><br />


### EchoLink

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB1ozVc2WKM&pp=ygUHRWNvbGluaw%3D%3D">VIDEO</a>:
Ecolink software runs on Windows and Android which streams VoIP data through the internet to a <strong>ham/amateur band</strong> base station.

### LoRa Meshtastic

LoRa technology is based on spread-spectrum modulation technique derived from chip spread spectrum (CSS) tech developed by Cycleo (of Grenoble, France), then acquired by Semtech, the founding member of the LoRA alliance.

LoRA devices connect with other LoRa devices on the license-free narrow ISM (industrial, Scientific, Medical) band to create a mesh network by <a target="_blank" href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic.org</a>. So that can be used "off-grid" in case the internet goes down.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqF9ZxWjmE">VIDEO</a>:
LoRA devices can communicate through the internet by connecting with Bluetooth on Android and iOS mobile phones which also have WiFi that connect to the internet. That and the <a target="_blank" href="https://beartooth.com/products/beartooth-mk-ii">$2,498 MK II</a>.

### Wires-X

https://systemfusion.yaesu.com/what-is-system-fusion/
Yeasu's "Fusion" solution uses continuous envelope <strong>C4FM 4-level FSK</strong> digital modulation technology to transmit digital voice and data over Amateur radio bands. 

The first version of the American digital intercom mechanism Project 25 (P25 for short) adopted C4FM, 

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1715636248/ham-wiresx-620x243_sid8du.jpg"><img alt="ham-wiresx-620x243.jpeg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1715636248/ham-wiresx-620x243_sid8du.jpg"></a>

http://c4fm.xyz/
The RF signal is amplified and transmitted to space through the antenna. The RF signal received by the receiver and passes through the frequency modulation demodulator, often referred to as a frequency discriminator circuit in analog mode. The demodulated result is a C4FM baseband signal whose amplitude varies between four voltage levels. After logical judgment and transformation of the level, a two-digit binary digit sequence is obtained. In order to improve the anti-interference performance, the process of extracting the digital signal from the four-level waveform usually uses a certain algorithm instead of using a simple voltage comparator. It is not substantially different from the well-known traditional analog FM, except that it is not an analog signal of voice that modulates the radio frequency input signal, but a digital signal with only four-level states.

As with D-STAR, C4FM uses FDMA (???) digital modulation mode with channel interval at 12.5 kHz.  C4FM FDMA provides a data transfer rate of 9.6 kbps.

RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service) uses amateur stations for civil defense communications during periods of local, regional, or national civil emergencies.

Thr National Radio Quiet Zone is an area in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia Bounded by 39°15′ N on the north, 78°30′ W on the east, 37°30′ N on the south and 80°30′ W on the west.

There is a 1-mile restriction around the 14 10-watt monitoring stations FCC operates in the US (11 in the continental US). They use 210-220 MHz in the 1.25-meter band.

Within 20 miles between <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/electromagnetic-compatibility-division/frequency-coordination-canada-below">Line A and Line B</a> formed in a 1962/5 treaty between US and Canada, amateur stations may not transmit in the
   * 420-430 MHz subband of the 70cm Amateur band
   * "650" and "700" channels, either simplex or duplex, of GMRS stations

No music can be transmitted except to the Space Station 50 km above earth.

## MUF/LUF

Usable frequencies that hop (refract) through the skip zone under the ionosphhere are between:

   * MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency)
   
   * LUF (Lowest Usable Frequency)

NVIS (Near Vertical Incident Skywave) bounces up (on a Critical Angle) for about (200-300 KM) 400 miles instead of out (around the world).

Long-peroidic TV antennas have wide-bandwidth frequencies from 6-meters at 54 Mhz to 800 MHz.


## Band Plans

Some of the most popular ham bands include:<br />
Band Name 	Frequency Range 	Band Type<br />
2 meters 	144-148 MHz 	VHF<br />
70 centimeters 	420-450 MHz 	UHF<br />
20 meters 	14-14.35 MHz 	HF<br />

When using an amp like a VHF power amplifier, the SSB/CW-FM switch sets the amplifier for the selected mode. The transmitter mode needs to be set to match change it.

An amp (amplifier) boosts your signal from 4 watts to 70 on VHF.
General or Extra class HF operators can use linear or tube amps to boost transmit power from 100 watts to the legal limit of 1,500 watts.

Use a RF preamplifier between the antenna and the receiver to boost weak signal reception.

## FM

A typical 50-watt output mobile FM transceiver, an appropriate power supply rating would be 13.8 volts at 12 amperes. For that a 10-ampere power supply is sufficient. (12 volts X 10 amperes = 120 watts, which is greater than the 50 watts of the radio).

## Hardware

<strong>Sensitivity</strong> is the ability of a receiver to detect the presence of a signal.
Parameters affecting receiver sensitivity:
   * Input amplifier gain
   * Demodulator stage bandwidth
   * Input amplifier noise
   <br /><br />

<strong>Selectivity</strong> is the ability of a receiver to discriminate between multiple signals

<strong>Modulation</strong> is combining speech with an RF carrier signal

Some modern amateur transmitters still offer high-stability crystal oscillators as an added accessory option.
<strong>oscillator</strong> circuits generate a signal at a specific frequency:
There are different types: Pierce and crystal. 


Append "QRP" to call sign when transmitted on less than 5 W digital or 10 W on voice.


### Transceivers

A transceiver –ombines the functions of a transmitter and a receiver.

PTT (Push-to-Talk) use an "AND" gate.

An oscillator circuit generates a signal at a specific transmit frequency and helps process the received signal.

### Transverter

A <strong>transverter</strong> converts RF input and output of a transceiver to another band. 
It functions via a mixer used to convert radio signals from one frequency to another.
For example, from 10-meter to 2-meter or 70-centimeters & back.

The mixer circuit converts a radio signal from one frequency to another. Two RF signals mixed together gets two additional frequencies. One will be the sum of the two frequencies and the other will be the difference of the two signals. So if you mix together a 5-MHz frequency and a 3-MHz frequency, you will get an 8-MHz frequency and a 2-MHz frequency. 5 MHz + 3 MHz = 8 MHz (sum) and 5 MHz - 3 MHz = 2 MHz (difference).


## Electronics

A <strong>transistor</strong> is an electronic gate.
It is composed of three layers of semiconductor material configured to dope with N and P dopants:
   * N-type transistor dopants donate electrons
   * P-type transistor dopants accept electrons. 
   <br /><br />

A <strong>bipolar junction transistor</strong> allows a small current at one terminal to control larger current at its other terminals allowing for amplification or switching. 
Energy passing from the collector to emitter is controlled by the base.

A transister is the only component in an RF power amplifier that produces gain.

A FET (Field-effect transistor) are commonly found in amateur radio receivers because of their efficiency in the RF ranges.
They use an electric field to control the flow of current. 
It's a unipolar transistor.
Its gate is used to control the current passing between the source and the drain.

The "skin effect": In AC circuits, current flows on the outside of the conductor.

<strong>Inductance</strong> is the ability to store energy in a magnetic field.
The basic unit of inductance is the <strong>henry</strong>. 

An <strong>inductor</strong> stores electrical energy in a <strong>magnetic</strong> field when current flows through it. 
Generally, the more turns of a coil, the higher the inductance.
Inductors are made of a coil of wire such as from small copper tubing.
So inductors are also called chokes or coils. 

A <strong>capacitor</strong> stores electrical energy in an <strong>electrical</strong> circuit. 
Its symbol is a line and a frown.
The conductive surfaces of a capacitor may be foil, film or metal 
separated by glass, ceramic, air or other elements that provide insulation.

An LC circuit -- a L (inductor) and a C (capacitor) connected in series or parallel to form a filter -- is a <strong>resonant</strong> or tuned circuit. 

A <strong>relay</strong> is an electrically-controlled electromagnet to switch current flow. 
Mechanical contacts control the flow of larger current.

SPDT (single pole, double throw) switches have a single input and two outputs. 
They are used as a “low / high” switch in a circuit.

## Digital modes

There are two different approaches:

   * Send VOIP (Voice Over IP) through the internet to FM stations via EchoLink Windows & Android apps
 
   * Send voice generated on a Linux laptop using direwolf

Packet radios use the AX.25 protocol standard based on the X.25 protocol. 
The "A" in AX.25 stands for amateur radio.

## Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s Law states that voltage (E) equals current (I) multiplied by resistance (R). 

The flow rate of one coulomb per second is equal to one amp of current.

Capacitance is the ability to store energy in an electric field and is measured in farads. The component in a circuit for this is a capacitor.


## Electrical Power

The power of electrical audio signals is measured in db (decibels) on a logrithmic scale.
Logrithmically means increases are exponential.
* For each 1 db of loss, there is a 20.6% change in power.
* At 3 dB, there is a 2x change in power.
* At 10 db, there is a 10x change in power

Power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed (converted to heat). 
A 40-watt bulb uses more power than a 100-watt bulb.

P (power watts) = E (volts) multiplied by I (current in amps).

A <strong>transformer</strong> steps down 120 volts AC house current to a lower AC voltage for other uses. There also are step-up transformers. 
In a diagram:
The left-hand side of the transformer is the primary winding.
The right hand side is the secondary winding.

A <strong>regulator</strong> regulates the amount of voltage from a power supply. 
So it's also called a voltage regulator. 
Some power supply designs use a single chip while others use many separate and independent components.

A <strong>rectifier</strong> changes an alternating current into a varying direct current signal. 
A rectifier is composed of diodes that direct the flow of current into specific directions in the electronic circuit. The diode allows current to flow in only one direction. 

The diode is classified as a semiconductor.
In the forward direction, a minimum amount of voltage, called the voltage drop, is required to have the diode conduct current. 

Within a diode, current flows into the anode and out of the cathode.

Because different materials are used in diodes, voltage drop is lower in some diode types.

The most difficult LED (Light Emmitting Diode) to make are purple in color.

In power supplies it sends the positive side of the alternating current's sine wave to one part of the circuit and the negative side to another part of the circuit.

## Batteries

Carbon-zinc batteries are not rechargeable. The chemical reactions that produce the electricity are not reversible.

When using lead-acid 12V batteries used in most autos and trucks, keep its voltage above 10.5 Volts to avoid shortening the battery's life.

LiFePo


## Multimeters

A directional wattmeter measures forward and reflected watts.

Multimeters are:
* An Ohmeter measures Ohms of resistance (when not powered)
* A voltmeter measures Volts of E (electric potential or electromotive force)
* An ammeter measures amps of electric current (measured in series in a circuit flowing through the ammeter)

Always start on a higher scan and slowly work down.

A dummy load uses a non-inductive <strong>resistor</strong> mounted on a heat sink. This simulates an antenna and helps avoid potential interference so you can test for as long as necessary, based on the dummy load’s rating.

A variable resistor of ohms is called a <strong>potentiometer</strong> (not a measurement device).
It has three electrical connections.

If only two connections are used, the device is called a rheostat.

### Solder

Good rosin solder joints are shiny rather than "gray" or dull.

Acid-core solder should NEVER be used for radio and electronic use. 
Cold tin-lead solder (made for steel and other metals) result in a rough or lumpy surface.

## Antennas

<a target="_blank" href="https://study.hamradioprep.com/courses/take/general-license-course-2023-2027/lessons/44706097-directional-specialized-antennas-video">VIDEO</a>:

"Isotropic" antennas measures gain in dBi directionally.

So lower power on Yagi antennas, which takes a signal from a driven element down the boom to the director element. Satellite antennas have 30 or more directors to narrow the beam.
* A 20-meter Yagi with 3 elements with beam width 65 degrees would have a 7 dBi gain.
* A 70-meter Yagi with 11 elements with beam width 35 degrees would have a 13 dBi gain.
<br /><br />

The azimuth is set by the number of elements on the boom.

Narrow the main lobe in elevation by stacking a Yagi a half-wavelength apart for gain 3dB higher than a single Yagi.

Gain in dBi is 25 dB higher than gain in dBd.

<strong>Dipole</strong> antennas measure gain in dBd.

To get the approximate length of a half-wavelength <strong>dipole</strong> (named for the Japanese who invented it), divide 468 by the frequency in megahertz:

For 6 meter with 50 Megahertz.  So 468 / 50 MHz = 9.36 Feet or 112.32 inches. 
If we need to calculate a quarter-wavelength, we can use half of 468 which is 234.  
For 2 Meter, calculate 468 / 146 MHz is 3.20 feet or 38.4 inches for a half-wavelength dipole.  Take half of that to get a quarter-wavelength and you get 19.2 inches. Or 234 / 146 MHz = 1.60 Feet or 19.2 inches.

The tried-and-true formula for <strong>quarter-wavelength</strong> antennas is divide 234 by the frequency in MHz. 234 / frequency in MHz = Antenna length in feet. Therefore, 234 / 146 MHz = 1.602 feet. To convert feet to inches, multiply by 12. Therefore, 1.602 feet x 12 = 19.2 inches.

The approximate length, in inches, of a quarter-wavelength vertical antenna for 146 MHz will be 19 inches. Let's break down the math: they want the length on an antenna in inches based on a given frequency. 

A 5/8-wavelength antenna has longer range and more gain when compared to the 1/4 wavelength antenna.

Around airports, antennas below 200 feet tall do not need FCC notification.

A <strong>band-pass filter</strong> filters out incoming signal.
Attenuation is the signal lost in the passband.

On a 80-meter dipole would have a height of 8 meters (26 feet) above ground.

A <strong>feed line</strong> carries signal between the antenna and your radio.

Using cable TV cables would cause an impedence mismatch.

The most-used coax have <strong>50 Ohms impedance</strong> to match modern amateur radios.

1:1 SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) is the ratio of Feed-point impedence (such as 200 Ohms) to Feed line impedence (such as 50 Ohms).

AC impedence loss to transceiver is measured in dB per 100 feet.

Keep SWR below 1.5:1, when less than 5% in transmitter loss (converted to heat) before getting out the antenna.<br />
At 2:1, loss is about 11%.<br />
4:1 means 40% of transmit power is lost.<br />
5:1 means more than half of power is lost.

An <strong>antenna tuner</strong> adjusts to present a 1:1 match to the transmitter.

## Overdeviating

Overdiating can be caused by talking too close to the microphone.

## Contact Keep a Log

Listen before you transmit.

Repeat “CQ” a few times, followed by “this is,” then your call sign a few times, then pause to listen. Repeat as necessary.

MEMORIZE: Use NATO phoetic alphabet.

To ensure that you aren't causing interference to others who are already having a conversation,
if you see a frequency that appears free, 
* On CW send “QRL?”, followed by your call sign.
* if using phone, ask if the frequency is in use, followed by your call sign. 
That's so they may be just not talking at that moment, but still using the frequency.
After making a contact with another ham, exchange a signal report of readability and strength, such as “This is AA1RC. You are 5-9 in South Texas”
for perfectly readable and very strong from these scales:

R5 = 95%+ Perfectly readable<br /> 
R4 = 80%+ Practically no difficulty; occassional missed characters<br />
R3 = 40%+ Considerable words distinguishable<br />
R2 = 20%+ Ocassional words distinguishable<br />
R1 = 00%+ Undecipherable<br />

Strength:
S9 = Very Strong<br />
S7 = Strong<br />
S5 = Moderate<br />
S3 = Weak<br />
S1 = Barely Perceptible<br />
]

“CQ DX” (means “distant”) is a call for any stations outside the lower 48 states. 
Such operate on 50.1 MHz to 50.125 MHz.

azimuthal projection maps show true bearings and distances from a specific location
It's used by hams to find the short-path between two stations. If an amateur turns their antenna 180 degrees, they would be using the long path to transmit.

## End conversations

Ending a conversation or transmission with "73" means "Best Regards" or goodbye. 
This harks back to the early days of landline Morse code telegraphy in the 1800s, when Telegraphers used numerical codes to represent common phrases to speed up transmission. BTW: In Morse code, "73" forms a palindromic sequence that is the same forwards and backwards, adding to its appeal and memorability for ham operators.
