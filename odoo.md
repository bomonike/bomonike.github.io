## Open Source

Since Odoo touts itself as "open source", let's look at their source.

1. See odoo's repositories:

   https://github.com/odoo

   https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/
   https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions

1. One comment about Odoo is that it doesn't have major industry-specific packs like NetSuite. However, oDoo has small industry demos at:

   https://github.com/odoo/industry

1. Design themes

   https://github.com/odoo/design-themes

   https://github.com/odoo/odoodays-2014/blob/master/create_themes/index.rst

1. See odoo's odoo repository

   https://github.com/odoo/master/odoo

1. Notice in the right column of odoo's repositories

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki

1. Link to "Qualified Wishlist" items open:

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awishlist

1. Count number of corporate agreements within the doc/cla/corporate folder:

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/17.0/doc/cla/corporate

1. Contributor analysis

   PROTIP: On the right column of the page, GitHub reports (as of May 17, 2024) <strong>1,943</strong> contributors over the life of the repository.

   QUESTION: If we look up the maintainers' email addresses from the git log and politely inquire about the project's status, what are their backgrounds? Are they paid or volunteers?

1. Code composition analysis

   PROTIP: GitHub reports that half of Odoo's code is in Python language. There is also JavaScript, SCSS (Sassy CSS preprocessor), CSS, HTML, Shell script. SCSS in .scss files extends the functionality of regular CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. It introduces programming constructs that allow developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code.

1. Select Odoo's Server Framework tutorial version at the upper-right:

   https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/tutorials/server_framework_101.html

   Odoo's presentation tier is being transitioned from (modern) HTML5, JavaScript and CSS to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md">OWL XML framework</a> to generate user interfaces in the browser.

   https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground/

   The logic tier is exclusively written in Python <strong>objects</strong>.<br />
   An <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM (Object Relational Mapping) layer</a> is used to access data stored in a PostgreSQL RDBMS.

   Only the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.odoo.com/page/editions">Enterprise version</a> supports mobile.

1. Operating system Debian

   * https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/master/setup

1. Determine the rate of Issue closure  ???

1. Trend of issues

   #165024 transitioning all frontend code from jQuery to Vanilla JavaScript.

1. Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1753/whats-the-right-way-to-ask-if-a-github-project-is-maintained">"lovely-forks" browser extension</a> to see if the project has any notable forks where development may be continuing.

1. Pull requests: Are they being fixed promptly (<a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1753/whats-the-right-way-to-ask-if-a-github-project-is-maintained">being maintained</a>)?

1. Click Insights to view statistics about it

   Excluding merges, <strong>155 authors</strong> have pushed 159 commits to 17.0 and 832 commits to all branches. On 17.0, 866 files have changed and there have been 23,203 additions and 5,528 deletions.

1. Click on the branch list to scroll to identify the <strong>default</strong> branch (17.0).

   See "This branch is 6612 commits ahead of, 4391 commits behind 17.0."

   CAUTION: The master branch is not production? We should not use it.

1. Click "branches" to view branch metadata at:

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/branches/active

1. Instead of getting all branches (which consumed 9.2G on May 8, 2024)<br />PROTIP: download only the branch for the latest named version, not the master (which consumed 1.1G):

   <pre>git clone --branch "17.0" git@github.com:odoo/odoo.git
   cd odoo
   du -sh
   git branch
   </pre>

1. Configuration (activations?)

   ## Multi-lingual

1. Docs about Translating

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Translations

1. Localization text are defined in a .po file for each <tt>i18n</tt> folder within each module.

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/master/addons/fleet/i18n


   ### Analyze Python dependencies:

1. <tt>code requirements.txt</tt>

   <pre># python3-* equivalent distributed in Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 11
   Babel==2.9.1  # min version = 2.6.0 (Focal with security backports)
   </pre>

   PROTIP: It's evident Odoo is paying attention to version numbers (and trying to stay ahead of security despite its app code dependent on prior versions) by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-security-A4GlMUzCRbOK0Kr6GnQYWA">security backports</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/backporting/">services vendor CrowdStrike</a>. QUESTION: How comprehensive is Odoo's testing infrastructure? What percentage of code is covered by testing?

1. Export SBOM about the 102 modules in the Dependency graph

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/network/dependencies

   Analyze the SBOM spdx json file output.

## Installation

### Manifest

When utility <tt>sdist</tt> processes the <tt>MANIFEST.in</tt> file, <tt>graft odoo</tt> specifies inclusion of non-Python files like data files, documentation, or other resources that are part of your Python package. By using graft, you don't have to list each individual file to be included in the MANIFEST.in file.

The order of commands is crucial.

The recursive-exclude * *.py[co] command in a MANIFEST.in file is used to exclude all bytecode files (files with .pyc or .pyo extensions) from being included in the source distribution created by the sdist command.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=benspaulding.python-manifest-template
"They can be tough because first you have to get the right configuration between all of the involved bits, such as setup.py, setup.cfg, and MANIFEST.in. Then you then need to play whack-a-mole testing your distribution or — actually probably and — take a very deep dive into distutils and setuptools code to figure out the nuance of the six template commands for including and excluding files."


### .gitignore

<tt>.gitignore</tt> does not contain "_DS_Store" from macOS because oDoo doesn't run on macOS.

https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/17.0/setup/debinstall.sh
contains <tt>apt-get update</tt>
