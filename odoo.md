## The Company

Odoo began in 2005 by founder <a target="_blank" href="https://www.odoo.com/event/odoo-experience-2021-2847/track/ask-me-anything-ama-with-fabien-odoo-s-founder-4196">VIDEO</a>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fpodoo/">Fabien Pinckaers</a>, who is now CEO.

Being in Belgium, the software has been internationalized for localization into various dialects of French (BE, CA, CH) and other languages.

Support to partners are from India.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/odoo/insights/">LinkeIn reports that</a>
while there has been a 83% 2-year growth in 22-24, the Median employee tenure is 1.6 years.

Odoo on 2024 was rated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CxP3Lw_fUo">#9 CRM</a> by Digital implementation guru Eric Emberling of 3rd Stage Consulting.

## Open Source?

Since Odoo touts itself as "open source", let's look at their source.

From inception, Odoo S.A (formerly OpenERP S.A) has released the core software as open source.
Since release V9.0, the company has transitioned to an open core model, which provides subscription-based proprietary enterprise software and cloud-hosted software as a service, in addition to the open source version. 

In 2013, the not-for-profit Odoo Community Association - <a target="_blank" href="https://odoo-community.org">odoo-community.org</a> (OCA) - was formed to promote the widespread use of Odoo and to support the collaborative development of Odoo features.

1. One comment about Odoo is that it doesn't have major industry-specific packs like NetSuite. However, oDoo has small industry demos at:

1. Count number of corporate agreements within the doc/cla/corporate folder:

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/17.0/doc/cla/corporate

1. Contributor analysis

   PROTIP: On the right column of the page, GitHub reports (as of May 17, 2024) <strong>1,943</strong> contributors over the life of the repository.

   QUESTION: If we look up the maintainers' email addresses from the git log and politely inquire about the project's status, what are their backgrounds? Are they paid or volunteers?

1. Code composition analysis

   PROTIP: GitHub reports that half of Odoo's code is in Python language. There is also JavaScript, SCSS (Sassy CSS preprocessor), CSS, HTML, Shell script. SCSS in .scss files extends the functionality of regular CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. It introduces programming constructs that allow developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code.

1. Select Odoo's Server Framework tutorial version at the upper-right:

   https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/tutorials/server_framework_101.html

   Odoo's presentation tier is being transitioned from (modern) HTML5, JavaScript and CSS to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md">OWL XML framework</a> to generate user interfaces in the browser.

   https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground/

1. Click on the branch list to scroll to identify the <strong>default</strong> branch (17.0).

   See "This branch is 6612 commits ahead of, 4391 commits behind 17.0."

   CAUTION: The master branch is not production? We should not use it.

1. Click "branches" to view branch metadata at:

1. Instead of getting all branches (which consumed 9.2G on May 8, 2024)<br />PROTIP: download only the branch for the latest named version, not the master (which consumed 1.1G):

   <pre>git clone --branch "17.0" git@github.com:odoo/odoo.git
   cd odoo
   du -sh
   git branch
   </pre>

## Installation

As described at https://github.com/bomonike/odoo-utils/blob/main/README.md

1. If the repo is private, get a GitHub token for read access at your GitHub's Account settings > Developer settings > Fine-grained Personal access tokens:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>

1. Click "Generate new token". Confirm access. Select Expiration "7 days". Give token a descriptive name (with a date)
    
1. Under "Select scopes", check the "read:packages" scope to grant read access to private repositories.
1. Click green "Generate token". Click the icon to copy the generated token to paste.

1. Open a Terminal instance to download shell script (instead of git clone):

   ```
   cd
   cd Projects
   export OS_TO_INSTALL="debian"  # or "ubuntu"
   export GITHUB_READ_TOKEN="???"  # DO NOT echo this secret!
   echo "OS_TO_INSTALL=\"${OS_TO_INSTALL}\" in $PWD"
   # Actually: https://github.com/bomonike/odoo-utils/blob/main/odoo_install_debian.sh
if [ -f "odoo_install_${OS_TO_INSTALL}.sh" ]; then
   echo "using $(ls -al odoo_install_${OS_TO_INSTALL}.sh)"
   sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bomonike/odoo-utils/main/odoo_install_${OS_TO_INSTALL}.sh?token=${GITHUB_READ_TOKEN}"
      # odoo_install_debian.sh?token=ghp_l 100%[===...===>]  13.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.1s
fi
   sudo chmod +x "odoo_install_${OS_TO_INSTALL}.sh"
   ```

2. Use text editor to modify the shell file if parameter values need to be made current going forward and thus updated in GitHub :

   ```
   OE_VERSION="17.0"
   # Based on https://www.debian.org/releases/
   OS_VERSION="12.0"
   ```
   
3. Set custom values that should not be set in a public script:

    ```
    export OE_SUPERADMIN="admin"
    export ADMIN_EMAIL="me@example.com"
    ```

5. Execute the script:

   ```
   sudo ./odoo_install_${OS_TO_INSTALL}.sh
   ```


https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/17.0/setup/debinstall.sh
contains <tt>apt-get update</tt>

### Manifest

When utility <tt>sdist</tt> processes the <tt>MANIFEST.in</tt> file, <tt>graft odoo</tt> specifies inclusion of non-Python files like data files, documentation, or other resources that are part of your Python package. By using graft, you don't have to list each individual file to be included in the MANIFEST.in file.

The order of commands is crucial.

The recursive-exclude * *.py[co] command in a MANIFEST.in file is used to exclude all bytecode files (files with .pyc or .pyo extensions) from being included in the source distribution created by the sdist command.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=benspaulding.python-manifest-template
"They can be tough because first you have to get the right configuration between all of the involved bits, such as setup.py, setup.cfg, and MANIFEST.in. Then you then need to play whack-a-mole testing your distribution or — actually probably and — take a very deep dive into distutils and setuptools code to figure out the nuance of the six template commands for including and excluding files."


### .gitignore

NOTE: <tt>.gitignore</tt> does not contain "_DS_Store" from macOS because Odoo doesn't run on macOS.

## Python Packages

There are two lists of Python packages below.

The first list are packages in the <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file 
as of v17.0 on May 20, 2024 at 
https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/17.0/requirements.txt
Each package name in the file is referenced in an <tt>import</tt> statement within a Python source code file. The description of each package was manually drafted from Snyk.com and other sources.

PROTIP: It's evident Odoo is paying attention to version numbers (and trying to stay ahead of security despite its app code dependent on prior versions) by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-security-A4GlMUzCRbOK0Kr6GnQYWA">security backports</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/backporting/">services vendor CrowdStrike</a>. QUESTION: How comprehensive is Odoo's testing infrastructure? What percentage of code is covered by testing?

Some packages are mentioned more than once when a different version needs to be used based on the version of Python used.

## SBOM

IMPORTANT: The commpany has no SOC2/27000 certification.

QUESTION: What RBAC permissions?

Never Paid ransomware?

1. Export SBOM about the 102 modules in the Dependency graph

   https://github.com/odoo/odoo/network/dependencies

   Analyze the SBOM spdx json file output.

You have discovered a security issue and want to report it, write us to: security@odoo-community.org. You can also encrypt and verify messages to/from our security team with our GPG Key with ID 0xed07aacf416f9287.

The Python packages below were discovered by looking into each package above and identifying what packages each referenced, then (recursively) looking each of those references, building a "Suply Chain Dependency graph" to identify vulnerabilities within indirectly obtained dependencies.
