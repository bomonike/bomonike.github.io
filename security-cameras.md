## The problems with security cameras

1. Wi-Fi can be jammed by a cheap jammer. It's best to use hard-wires.
1. It's best to use local recording. Most cameras made in China sends videos to China (even though they say they don't).

## Eufy

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eufy
the Eufy company is a smart home brand launched in 2016 by parent Anker Innovations,
starting with robot vacuum cleaners.

Both Eufy and Anker operate from Shengen, China. 

WARNING: Although Eufy clains "local storage", it continues to send videos to China "to create thumbnails". Although "end-to-end encryption" is claims references transmission and not storage on Eufy's servers, which can be accessed by Chinese political authorities.

   The camera creates a network named starting with "eufy".
   It's ironic that the camera is 4K resolution but can only connect to a 2.4GHz wi-fi, so you cannot connect directly to newer gateways which have a 5Ghz channel.
   Connect your Mac to the Wi-Fi network.

Hold down the Option (⌥) key on the keyboard.

While holding the Option key, click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar at the top right of the screen.

A detailed Wi-Fi info window will appear. Look for the "Channel" field—if the channel number is between 1 and 14, the Mac is connected to a 2.4GHz network.

Also, look for the "Tx Rate" or "Transmit Rate" field in the window, which shows the current connection speed in Mbps on that 2.4GHz network.

PROTIP: hook up an older hub to your Gateway.

On HomeKit: 3840x2160 @15FPS with 125 degree diagonal FOV
