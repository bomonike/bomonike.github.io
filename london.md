In London and much of Europe, churches are converted to pubs, shops, and restaurants.
The Mercato Mayfair is a popular two-story food from around the world. It used to be St. Mark's Church. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwdCKxz9s7w&t=3m12s">VIDEO</a>

## London from East to West and North:

PROTIP: Get a Osyter card for the Tube (subway) and buses. Use it (instead of a VISA card) to get free rides after five rides the same day.
Get a refund on the card when you leave.

## Heathrow airport

* PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heathrow.com/at-the-airport/airport-services/fast-track">Book a Fastrack through Security</a> through your airline. It's £12.50, but worth it to avoid the long lines.

* PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://thriftylondoner.com/cheapest-place-to-exchange-money-in-london/">Exchange your money</a> at a Post Office, which doesn't charge transaction fees.

* PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heathrow.com/at-the-airport/terminal-guides/which-terminal">Find out what Terminal you are flying out of. A different terminal for a different city on the same airline</a>. There are four terminals, and they are not connected. You can take a free bus between terminals, but that takes 20 minutes.

   * Delta is in Terminal 3. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-1Zq7gKZB/">

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/tickets-and-offers/tickets-offers#/">Book ahead</a> for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/">Heathrow Express</a> from London (£5.50 instead of 25).
