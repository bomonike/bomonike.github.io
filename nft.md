The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystem was created because copies of digital media can be easily duplicated. Digital media include music audio, video, or images in GIF/PNG/JPEG format.


## The first NFT trade

<img align="right" alt="quantum-kevin-mcoy-500x347.png" width="100" height="100" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736451085/quantum-kevin-mcoy-500x347_tplugn.png" />
This piece of digital art, named "Quantum", is the <a target="_blank" href="https://nftnow.com/art/quantum-the-first-piece-of-nft-art-ever-created/">first NFT</a> to be minted, in 2014.

The digital artists who created it, Jennifer and NYU professor Kevin McCoy (of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mccoyspace.com/projects">mycoyspace.com</a>), teamed up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.anildash.com/about/">Anil Dash</a> to create the tech to sell <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mccoyspace.com/projects/cars">a digital image</a> (for $4) through the Namecoin blockchain. In <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/96131398">a recording of the demo</a>.

After McCoy promoted Quantum on media outlets like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2021/03/25/nft-sale-art-blockchain-millions">Axios</a>, in June of 2021 he put the Quantum NFT up for auction among Sotheby’s art collectors who bought it for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/quantum">more than one million dollars</a>.

The ERC-721 standard was developed to specify the minting of unique tokens.


## NFT marketplaces

There are several NFT marketplaces.

<img alt="cryptopunks-900x399.webp" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736487680/cryptopunks-900x399_njypxq.webp">
The above is CryptoPunks's gallery on
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensea.com/">Opensea.com</a>,
currently the most popular marketplace for NFT art.

Rarible and Superratr are other marketplaces.

Opensea was used in Martha Stewart's 2021 collaboration with the Tokns UK NFT agency to create Shopify marthafreshmint.com to sell NFTs of photographs.
It's now defunct.

One gimmick is that the NFTs are randomly assigned to purchasers. Buyers can only uncover an NFT’s content and rarity once it is opened. Purchasers looking to resell the NFT for a profit will have to decide whether it is more valuable to sell it opened or unopened.

## Crypto wallets

Payment through the marketplace can be in fiat money such as a normal credit card.

But a web3 cryptowallet allows for accepting royalties as well.

Several other blockchains support NFTs, each with its own community and decentralized apps (dApps) for creators and NFT owners.

<a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask.com</a>
is currently the most popular crypto wallet.
It can be used as a mobile app or added as an extension to many browsers (not Safari).
It supports Ethereum and Solana blockchains plus a wide variety of cryptocurrencies. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/metamask-cryptocurrency-wallet-review-5235562">more</a>.

https://www.investopedia.com/coinbase-wallet-review-5225031
Coinbase Wallet: Coinbase offers a digital wallet that supports ERC-721 NFT tokens and Solana NFT collections. It can be downloaded as a mobile app or added as a browser extension.

https://www.investopedia.com/ledger-nano-s-vs-x-5188903
Ledger Nano X: If you want to store your NFT keys in a secure hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X supports both Ethereum and Solana NFTs.



## API libraries

NFTs can be created, bought, sold, and transferred within various <a href="#Blockchains">blockchain networks</a> using these libraries:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview">OpenSea API</a>

* Web3.py

The API fetches ERC721 and ERC1155 token metadata

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/">Metamask's SDK</a> support for libraries <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/3rd-party-libraries/wagmi/">Wagmi</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/3rd-party-libraries/web3-onboard/">Web3-Onboard</a>.

??? NFTs provides a way of establishing the <strong>provenance</strong> of a digital piece of art -- the documentation which indelibly authenticates the creator, ownership history, and appraisal value of a specific piece of art.

NFTs enable an image to be verfied as the authentic creation of an artist (Twitter account).

NFTs also enable a person to assert ownership of the image to be verified by others.

## Like vehicle VINs

A unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is generated by auto manufacturers for each vehicle created. It's displayed on each vehicle for tracking during transport and services performed. The VIN is reference by the DMV to track vehicle ownership and licensing. VIN numbers are posted on ads for each auto to ensure that the specific vehicle being advertised is the one being actually sold.

One can even create virtual real estate on a piece of digital land in virtual reality <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avast.com/c-metaverse">Metaverse</a> of networked 3D worlds.

NFTs provide a way to ensure that each creation can be owned by only one person at a time.

When you sell an NFT, you typically transfer over the rights of ownership, but keep your intellectual property rights. When you make NFT art, it gains a unique certificate of authenticity that can be held by only one person at a time. You can always create a new piece with the same style.

Most NFT marketplaces let you choose whether to transfer the copyright upon sale. Copyright laws vary by country as far as what ideas are copyrightable.

Use of NFTs requires an understanding of <a href="#Minting">minting</a>, <a href="#Blockchain">blockchain</a>, <a href="#SmartContracts">smart contracts</a>, <a href="#CryptoWallet">cryptocurrency wallets</a>, <a href="#Marketplaces">marketplaces</a>, and <a href="#GasFees">gas fees</a>.

## Hashes

Those who provide a digital file for download usually provide a string which recipients can compare after recalculating the string from the file downloaded. Generating the same string (<strong>cryptopgraphic hash</strong>) on both ends proves that nothing was alterned during transmission. The string is called "SHA256" for the mathematical algorithm used to generate the string on both ends. Such functions generate a different hash value when even a single bit is different.

<a name="Minting"></a>

## Minting into a blockchain

NFTs extend the use of cryptographic hashes to provide a guarantee of true uniqueness in time and space by enshrining the hash within a <strong>blockchain</strong>, which is a chain of strong digital certificates that are very difficult to alter.
Because each NFT is unalterably unique within a blockchain, ownership can be confirmed.
And changes in ownership can be recorded safely as well.

NFTs also include <strong>metadata</strong> describing the asset it represents, plus a link (IPFS URL) to where the asset content is listed and stored. The IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file storage protocol that allows users to store and access content without a central server. See https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/

??? Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a link to the previous block, forming a chain.

??? information is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. This makes blockchain ideal for ensuring trust in data integrity and authenticity.

<a name="GasFees"></a>

## Gas fees

Each blockchain charges a one-time $50 - $300

Royalties up to 10% ???

The cost of creating NFT is recovered with "gas fees" charged when NFTs are transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.



<a href="#Blockchains"></a>

## Blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Flow)

The most popular NFT blockchain is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp">Ethereum</a>, which hosts thousands of NFT collections. Ethereum NFTs are created utilizing the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, which store the metadata of the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-721 standard was developed by the same teams that developed the ERC-20 smart contract and defines the minimum interface—ownership details, security details, and metadata—required for exchanging and distributing tokens.

Different blockchains validate transactions in different ways (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Stake), which affect gas fees, processing speeds, security, and even the environment differently — minting NFTs is energy intensive.
Ethereum uses Proof-of-Stake to confirm transactions, which is the most secure. The main drawback of Ethereum is the high gas fees for each transaction.

Blockchains currently operates using the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, making it much more eco-friendly than it used to be. Most NFT marketplaces support the creation of Ethereum NFTs, though transferring NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain may come with high gas fees.

Ethereum is used by other projects (called sidechains) for creating NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Polygon is one of the more popular sidechains for NFTs, used by some businesses and fans.


<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/solana-5210472">Solana</a>

The nearest competitor to the Ethereum blockchain is Solana. Designed as a faster, lower-cost alternative to Ethereum, Solana offers transaction fees of less than $0.01 and a growing list of supported apps for NFTs. In addition, Solana utilizes both the proof-of-history (PoH) and PoS consensus mechanisms and boasts much faster transaction speeds than Ethereum.

At <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.flow.com/build/getting-started/contract-interaction">flow.com</a>
is a PoS blockchain designed for NFTs and decentralized gaming apps. Many other sports franchises have created marketplaces on the Flow blockchain, making it popular for sports-focused NFT creation. It enables use of Apple Pay for fans to buy popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/"> NBA Top Shot NFT collection</a> of officially licensed NFT trading card line with embedded video of a player’s best moments.



## Smart Contracts

Blockchain technology also enables the addition of rules (code) in "smart contracts" that are automatically invoked (enforced) when predefined conditions are met.
Such self-executing contracts operate without the need for intermediaries.

Smart contracts are like rules (covenants) added to real estate property deeds processed by escrow agents.

Smart contracts can limit resell such as the amount of commission returned to the orginal artist each time the artwork is transferred.

Solidity is commonly used for this purpose.

Smart contracts on Etherium nodes run the decentralized virtual environment
<a target="_blank" href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM (Etherium Virtual Machine)</a>.
EVMs use "gas" to measure the computational effort required for operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network security.


<a href="#CryptoWallet"></a>

## Cryptocurrency Wallets

To create an NFT and sell it online, you first need a crypto wallet linked to a compatible blockchain. Then you can pick a suitable marketplace, upload your file to “mint” your NFT, and list it for sale.

associated with a token stored on a NFT marketplace.

Most marketplaces offer royalty fees, which reward the NFT creator if their NFT is resold. The percentage of the royalty changes depending on the marketplace. Royalties can be from 5% to as high as 50%.


A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital asset with markers that make it unique and, through the use of blockchain technology,

 NFTs can be artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, or any media file that can be assigned a unique digital identifier and placed on a blockchain.

Human beings naturally find rare objects valuable, and NFTs guarantee authenticity and ownership, making them rare, useful as status symbols, and convertible to cash via cryptocurrency. After NFTs are put on a blockchain, which acts as a digital ledger, they can't be copied.


<a name="Marketplaces"></a>

A token is the item's information hashed into an alphanumeric string.
This token is stored on the blockchain and establishes ownership of a digital item.

 ??? ownable by only one person at a time.



he token itself is hashed information stored on the blockchain. The digital item, tagged with metadata, is stored somewhere else, like Amazon Web Services or another hosting service. This is why you can right-click on the picture on an NFT auction site and save it—it is only the image. But your copy does not have the data associated with the NFT, so you're not the owner. In a sense, you have a forged copy.
