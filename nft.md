<i>{{ page.excerpt }}</i>
{% include _toc.html %}

The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystem was created because copies of digital media can be easily duplicated.

"Digital media" file formats include music audio (mp3), video (mp4), or images (GIF/PNG/JPEG).
NFTs can be artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, or any media file.
<a target="_blank" href="https://magiceden.us/collections/polygon/0x251be3a17af4892035c37ebf5890f4a4d889dcad">
Courtyard.io</a> sells paper trading cards.

However, NFTs enable a person to assert ownership that can be verified by others.
Each NFT is a unique digital identifier enshrined in a chain of cryptographic hashes within a blockchain.
So an NFT can be owned only by one party at a time.
NFTs enable an image to be verified as the authentic creation of an artist.

NFTs provides a way of establishing the <strong>provenance</strong> of a digital piece of art --
providing documentation which indelibly authenticates the creator, ownership history, and
appraisal value of a specific piece of art.

* DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization | A group of people working together to achieve a common goal without the need for a central authority.


## Starting from Bitcoin

Traditional payment infrastructure falls short:

   * Credit cards charge fees of 2-3% on every transaction
   * Settlement takes days
   * Anti-fraud systems (such as CAPTCHA and 2FA) were built to require human intervention to prevent fraud, thus not facilitate automated autonomous payments by agents instead of people

### Bitcoin ETFs

It is no secret that Bitcoin's (BTC) price has experienced significant fluctuations since its inception in 2009. Each price movement is influenced by a complex interplay of technological advancements, regulatory changes, market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin faced regulatory pressure, collapse of major crypto firms, which further rattled investor confidence, and rising interest rates (2021-2023). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin ETFs</a> debut (2024) led to renewed interest and price rise.

After the election of Trump, on January 10, 2024, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC), issued a Statement on the Approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products. After rejecting more than 20 applications between 2018 and 2024, the SEC approved trading for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.

Globally, the three types of Bitcoin ETF available are:
   * Bitcoin spot ETF
   * Bitcoin futures ETF. This removes the need for the ETF issuer to hold bitcoin in reserve.
   * Leveraged bitcoin futures ETF

Bitcoin ETF Providers:

   * iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust (IBIT)
   * Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB)
   * ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)
   * Franklin Templeton Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)
   * Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)
   * WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)

These funds benchmark and strike the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the ETFs to the Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant (BRRNY) provided by CF Benchmarks - a Kraken company.

## The first NFT trades ever

<img align="right" alt="quantum-kevin-mcoy-500x347.png" width="100" height="100" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736451085/quantum-kevin-mcoy-500x347_tplugn.png" />
This piece of digital art, named "Quantum", is the <a target="_blank" href="https://nftnow.com/art/quantum-the-first-piece-of-nft-art-ever-created/">first NFT</a> to be minted, in 2014.

The digital artists who created it, Jennifer and NYU professor Kevin McCoy (of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mccoyspace.com/projects">mycoyspace.com</a>), teamed up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.anildash.com/about/">Anil Dash</a> to create the tech to sell <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mccoyspace.com/projects/cars">a digital image</a> (for $4) through the Namecoin blockchain. In <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/96131398">a recording of the demo</a>.
After McCoy promoted his work on media outlets like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2021/03/25/nft-sale-art-blockchain-millions">Axios</a>,
in June of 2021 he put the "Quantum" NFT up for auction among Sotheby’s art collectors who bought it for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/quantum">more than one million dollars</a>.

## Music blockchains

Clarian North was the first musician to ever mint a music album as NFT, on OpenSea March 3rd, 2022.
His “Whale Shark LP” album beat Kings of Leon to it.
North also built NFT marketplace <a target="_blank" href="https://magiceden.us/polygon">MagicEden.us/Polygon tokens</a> (MATIC), a cheaper and faster alternative to Ethereum mainnet. In 2023 he published (via Packt) a 3-hour video course (<a target="_blank" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/course/the-complete-solidity/9781805122470/">on OReilly.com</a>) about the Solidity Smart Contract language.

<strong>Smart Contracts</strong> associated with a NFT is what enable its owner to receive <strong>royalties</strong>
from those who play music from the <a target="_blank" href="https://tamastream.info/">Tamago.info</a> Decentralized
Music Streaming Platform.

Smart Contracts also enable creators to receive <strong>commissions</strong> on each future sale of the NFT.

## Tamago player

The Tamago platform uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://near.org/">NEAR Layer-1 blockchain</a>
(<a target="_blank" href="https://near.ai/">NEAR protocol</a> with JavaScript and Rust WASM coding).

Blockchains enable Trust Without intermediaries, replacing the need for central authorities, enabling "trustless" transactions.
   * Security: They safeguard the network from attacks and ensure data integrity.
   * Decentralization: They distribute decision-making power among network participants.
   * Resilience: They eliminate single points of failure, ensuring high availability.

## NEAR Protocol

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRvtA_-jV2Q" title="Tech Showcase">VIDEO</a>:
NEAR.ai was created in 2017 by one of the Generative AI pioneers who authored the seminal "Attention is all you need" article at Google.

<img alt="near-tech-1299x605.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1738552519/near-tech-1299x605_n5swwn.png" />

"User-Owned AI" front-end combines "AI Assistants" with AI Agents finds the best for you.

NEAR is able to achieve high scalability and fast transaction processing because of its sharding technology (called <a target="_blank" href="https://discovery-domain.org/papers/nightshade.pdf">Nightshade</a>) with its utilization of a "Proof of Stake (PoS)" consensus mechanism (instead of the Beacon Chain used by others).

## Metamask

Among <a target="_blank" href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/">Ethereum Wallets</a>

1. Install Metamask for iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox (by danfinlay)
   (Safari not supported)

   https://metamask.io/download/

   PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU318siygUk">VIDEO</a>: Fees are difficult to compare. Beware of fees to withdraw to USD and other fiat currencies.

1. Select your location. Crypto.com is not allowed in New York.

1. Crypto.com's own CRO currency, which can be more volatile than other cryptocurrencies.

   PROTIP: Purchasers pay the Taker Fee when an order is placed and the Maker Fee when an order is matched and filled. Higher "bps" (basis points) are paid for low volume trades. 0.40% is 40 bps. 60 bps is the upper end of the range for small trades.

1. Consider deals by affiliates such as

   * $200 to signup on Coinbase through https://coinbase.mattscrypto.com/ But they charge 1% on the first $1000
   * MoonPay to buy crypto using Venmo through http://moonpay.mattscrypto.com/
   * $10 of free Bitcoin on Kraken through http://kraken.mattscrypto.com/

1. Fund with credit card.
1. Scroll down to compare rates from providers:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/currencies/near/">CoinMarketCap</a>,
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/near-protocol">CoinGecko</a>,
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/near">Blockchain</a>,

   PROTIP: Ramp and Coinbase are among the lowest rates.

   Strike: Offers an average 0.93% spread on Bitcoin purchases, making it one of the cheapest options8.
Kraken Pro: Charges some of the lowest fees in the crypto asset exchange industry, with trading fees ranging from 0.16% to 5%24.
Crypto.com: Offers trading fees between 0% and 2.99%, depending on the type of transaction2.
Gemini: Provides fees starting at 0.5%, with a maximum of 1.49% for crypto-to-crypto trades and up to 3.99% for fiat-to-crypto purchases12.
Coinbase: Fees range from 0% to 4%, varying by transaction type2.
Among these options, Strike and Kraken Pro appear to offer the lowest fees for buying crypto from USD. However, it's important to consider other factors such as security, available cryptocurrencies, and user experience when choosing an exchange3.

## NFT marketplaces on blockchains

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/videos/crypto101/uCC1J?query=nft&page=2&sortBy=BEST_MATCH&authProvider=mckinsey&source=search">VIDEO</a>:
There are several NFT marketplaces: OpenSea, MagicEden.us, Rarible, Superrare, etc.

<a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks"><img alt="cryptopunks-900x399.webp" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1736487680/cryptopunks-900x399_njypxq.webp" /><br />
The above is CryptoPunks's gallery</a> from https://lavalabs.com/cryptopunks, launched as a fixed set of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel characters in mid-2017. Although it doesn't comply with standards ERC-20, ERC-721, etc., it is now one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/rankings">most popular</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensea.com/">Opensea.com</a>. It inspired the modern CryptoArt movement. On Feb 2022, the #5822 fetched $23 million dollars (8,000 ETH).

10,000 ERC-271 tokens (Apes) from the Bored Ape Yacht Club provides NFT holders with members-only benefits such as access to a private digital board, offline parties hosted by Yuga Labs, etc. with celebrities such as Steph Curry, Madonna, Eminen, etc. Yuga Labs released ERC-20 "AppCoin" tokens Otherdeed.

Axie Infinity Play-to-Earn (P2E) game was developed by Sky Mavis in 2018.
Axies are the name of digital pets in the ERC-721 game,
which involves collecting, breeding for battle with others using Axies.
It started on Etherium and moved to the Ronin Etherium sidechain for faster and less expensive transactions.


Opensea was used in Martha Stewart's 2021 collaboration with the Tokns UK NFT agency to create
Shopify marthafreshmint.com to sell NFTs of photographs.
It's now defunct.

On Auguest 2024, SEC issues Wells Notice to OpenSea.

NFT games like Axie Infinity, virtual worlds like Decentraland.

Roofstock.com is revolutionizing real estate by using web3 blockchain.

One gimmick is that the NFTs are randomly assigned to purchasers.
Buyers can only uncover an NFT’s content and rarity once it is opened.
Purchasers looking to resell the NFT for a profit will have to
decide whether it is more valuable to sell it opened or unopened.

The Bored Ape Yaught Club created buzz through exclusivity by allowing only those who

## Crypto wallets

Payment through the marketplace can be in fiat money (issued as cash by governments) such as a normal credit card.

The web3 cryptowallet allows for accepting royalties as well.

Several other blockchains support NFTs, each with its own community and decentralized apps (dApps) for creators and NFT owners.

<a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask.com</a>
is currently the most popular crypto wallet (even though it doesn't run on Apple's Safari browser).
It can be used as a mobile app or added as an extension to many browsers (not Safari).
It supports Ethereum and Solana blockchains plus a wide variety of cryptocurrencies.

ERC-721, ERC-721A, or ERC-1155 compliant. Metaplex

## NFT API libraries

NFTs can be created, bought, sold, and transferred within various <a href="#Blockchains">blockchain networks</a>
using several libraries:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview">OpenSea API</a>

* Web3.py

The API fetches ERC721 tokens and ERC1155 token metadata.

The ERC-721 standard was developed to specify the minting of unique tokens.

Use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/batch-json-rpc-requests/">RPC request batching</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/wallet-interoperability/">EIP-6963</a> for wallet discovery to connect to MetaMask without conflict, and wallet security enhancements.


## Like vehicle VINs

A unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is generated by auto manufacturers for each vehicle created. It's displayed on each vehicle for tracking during transport and services performed. The VIN is reference by the DMV to track vehicle ownership and licensing. VIN numbers are posted on ads for each auto to ensure that the specific vehicle being advertised is the one being actually sold.

One can even create virtual real estate on a piece of digital land in virtual reality <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avast.com/c-metaverse">Metaverse</a> of networked 3D worlds.

NFTs provide a way to ensure that each creation can be owned by only one person at a time.

https://nftnow.com/art/quantum-the-first-piece-of-nft-art-ever-created/


When you sell an NFT, you typically transfer over the rights of ownership, but keep your intellectual property rights. When you make NFT art, it gains a unique certificate of authenticity that can be held by only one person at a time. You can always create a new piece with the same style.

Most NFT marketplaces let you choose whether to transfer the copyright upon sale. Copyright laws vary by country as far as what ideas are copyrightable.

Use of NFTs requires an understanding of <a href="#Minting">minting</a>, <a href="#Blockchain">blockchain</a>, <a href="#SmartContracts">smart contracts</a>, <a href="#CryptoWallet">cryptocurrency wallets</a>, <a href="#Marketplaces">marketplaces</a>, and <a href="#GasFees">gas fees</a>.

## Hashes

Those who provide a digital file for download usually provide a string which recipients can compare after recalculating the string from the file downloaded. Generating the same string (<strong>cryptopgraphic hash</strong>) on both ends proves that nothing was alterned during transmission. The string is called "SHA256" for the mathematical algorithm used to generate the string on both ends. Such functions generate a different hash value when even a single bit is different.

<a name="Minting"></a>

## Minting into a blockchain

NFTs extend the use of cryptographic hashes to provide a guarantee of true uniqueness in time and space by enshrining the hash within a <strong>blockchain</strong>, which is a chain of strong digital certificates that are very difficult to alter.
Because each NFT is unalterably unique within a blockchain, ownership can be confirmed.
And changes in ownership can be recorded safely as well.

NFTs also include <strong>metadata</strong> describing the asset it represents, plus a link (<a href="#IPFS">IPFS</a> URL) to where the asset content is listed and stored.

??? Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a link to the previous block, forming a chain.

??? information is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. This makes blockchain ideal for ensuring trust in data integrity and authenticity.

## Filecoin

Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralized storage network designed to store and retrieve data securely and efficiently. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to store files on the internet using blockchain technology.

<a name="IPFS"></a>

## IPFS

The IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) <a target="_blank" href="https://ipfs.tech">https://ipfs.tech</a> is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file storage protocol that enable users to store and access content without a central server. It's used by:

   * https://d.tube a YouTube clone on its Avalon blockchain
   * app.Uniswap.org blockchain app (URL uniswap.exchange) ENS contenthash for uniswap.eth for uniswap.eth.link

Notice that files take longer to load than HTTP servers.

CAUTION: IPFS is not an anonymous system because it needs each user's IP address is visible when sharing files.

Unlike HTTP which retrieve data based on a specific location defined by an IP address,
IPFS, uses "content-based addressing" which enables a peer-to-peer exchanges:

<img alt="ipfs-vs-http-383x222.png from eraser.io" width="383" height="222" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1737126071/ipfs-vs-http-383x222_dsvqgn.png" />

This distribution of content by IPFS is immutable.
Once added, files can't be deleted from it (by government censors).

    * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qarW5KhIWXE">How to use the Pinata IPFS API</a>

Alternatives for NFT storage are IPFS, Filecoin (which ensures files are backed up), Arweave.

1. To create a temporary link to a file's content only on your local machine, use this web page:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://share.ipfs.io/#/">https://share.ipfs.io/#/</a>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8i8qn8APR4&t=3m56s">VIDEO</a>
   Notice at the upper-right corner is the "PeerID" - a long random number created for your computer.

   It's referenced by the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), the catalog of all addresses in IPFS.
   IPNS uses both DHT and libp2p PubSub for publishing and resolving records, offering different trade-offs in terms of global consistency and speed.

1. Drag and drop a file to create a IPFS CID (Content IDentifiers) such as:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://share.ipfs.io/#/bafybeigiepgawww4qsdmwwv5m4zzsaaexwwnnsrfsi4xojfybri3qragju">https://share.ipfs.io/#/bafybeigiepgawww4qsdmwwv5m4zzsaaexwwnnsrfsi4xojfybri3qragju</a>

   That URL link is made up of a SHA256 hash created based on the file's content.

   CIDv0 is 46 characters long and always starts with "Qm". It uses a base 58-encoded multihash to create the content identifier.

   CIDv1 adds to v0 multi-base prefix, CID version identifier, and multi-codec identifier.

   Like git, IPFS also constructs a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in an interlocking chain of hashes.
   So the content associated with a CID is very difficult to change.
   Each change adds another CID to the chain.
   Thus, IPFS is also called the "permanent web".

1. Share the QR code so people can load the URL using a mobile phone.

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIiCdRZbxOE&t=11m10s">However</a>, IPFS does not have a "human friendly" way to discover CIDs and search through their content.

   <img alt="web3-xmit-table.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1737231722/web3-xmit-table_p3tryb.png" />

   So get a private IPFS Gateway & hubs such as from <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pinata.cloud/web3/ipfs-101/what-are-cids">

1. To make permanent address within the IPFS, "Set pinning" to a local node, which makes it available to be found and imported by others (peer nodes). Each download distributes the file in an additional node.
   Thus, the more that a file is shared, the faster it becomes.

   Publish to IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System), add your files or directory to IPFS using these CLI command:

   ```
   MY_CONTENT_HASH=$( ipfs add -r "$MY_CONTENT_DIRECTORY" )
   ipfs key gen "$MY_KEY_NAME"
   ipfs name publish --key="$MY_KEY_NAME" /ipfs/"$MY_CONTENT_HASH"
   ```

  * IPNS records are typically republished every 4 hours by default to keep them alive in the network.

1. To setup human-readable URLs to frequently shared files, use (set up) a dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc3-UzHtDzE">IPFS gateway</a>.

1. NOTE: IPFS apps can communicate using the IPFS project's IPFS protocol:

   <tt>ipns://k2k4r8nismm5mmgrox2fci816xvj4l4cudnuc55gkfoealjuiaexbsup#IPFS-Toolkit</tt>

1. More advanced features like IPNS record management and IPFS PubSub functionality. When using IPNS over PubSub, the system calculates a topic name from the IPNS name and joins it by querying the DHT for the topic's provider records2.

<a name="GasFees"></a>

## Gas fees

The cost of creating NFT is recovered with "gas fees" charged when NFTs are 
transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.

Each blockchain charges a one-time $50 - $300.
That can be steep.

Royalties up to 10% ???



<a href="#Blockchains"></a>

## Blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Flow)

The most popular NFT blockchain is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp">Ethereum</a>, which hosts thousands of NFT collections. Ethereum NFTs are created utilizing the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, which store the metadata of the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-721 standard was developed by the same teams that developed the ERC-20 smart contract and defines the minimum interface—ownership details, security details, and metadata—required for exchanging and distributing tokens.

Different blockchains validate transactions in different ways (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Stake), which affect gas fees, processing speeds, security, and even the environment differently — minting NFTs is energy intensive.
Ethereum uses Proof-of-Stake to confirm transactions, which is the most secure. The main drawback of Ethereum is the high gas fees for each transaction.

Blockchains currently operates using the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, making it much more eco-friendly than it used to be. Most NFT marketplaces support the creation of Ethereum NFTs, though transferring NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain may come with high gas fees.

Ethereum is used by other projects (called sidechains) for creating NFTs and cryptocurrencies.
polygonscan.com is one of the more popular sidechains for NFTs, used by some businesses and fans.

Blockchain miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.

Ethereum and Bitcoin began by using <strong>Pow (Proof of Work)</strong>, which is energy-intensive, slow, and struggles with scalability.

So in 2023 Etherium merged to use <strong>PoS (Proof of Stake)</strong>, which offers scalability and efficiency while maintaining a degree of decentralization. Cardano also uses PoS. Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake. Custodial MPC Wallets alsp include Aptos and Sui.

Ethereum has been the default for a long time, so almost every wallet and NFT app supports it because users perceive it to be high-status and secure. However, Etherium is also expensive and slow (costing above $10 just to mint a single NFT taking minutes to be finalized).

Cardano and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/solana-5210472">Solana</a>
utilize both PoS and <strong>Proof-of-History (PoH)</strong> consensus mechanisms to boast faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. Solana transaction fees are less than $0.01 along with a growing list of supported apps for NFTs.
PoH timestamps transactions to improve speed and scalability.

Solana is not compatible with Ethereum and thus not universally supported like Ethereum. But its transactions are very fast (sub-second) and almost too cheap to meter. That has led Solana to recently exceeded Ethereum in NFT activity.

<a target="_blank" href="https://developers.flow.com/build/getting-started/contract-interaction">flow.com</a>
is a PoS blockchain designed for NFTs and decentralized gaming apps. Many other sports franchises have created marketplaces on the Flow blockchain, making it popular for sports-focused NFT creation. It enables use of Apple Pay for fans to buy popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">"NBA Top Shot" NFT collection</a> of officially licensed NFT trading card line with embedded video of a player’s best moments.

Hybrid mechanisms are emerging as innovative solutions to strike a balance between the trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization.

* With Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), stakeholders vote for delegates to validate transactions on their behalf. Used by EOS, TRON -- More centralized than PoW and PoS. But Extremely fast and scalable.

* With Proof of Authority (PoA), a small, trusted group of validators is pre-selected to manage the network, which is  efficient and fast. Used by VeChain and private blockchains with limited decentralization.

* With Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), nodes communicate to agree on a decision, even if some are unreliable or malicious. Fault-tolerant, secure. Used by Hyperledger, Cosmos, who struggle with scalability.

<strong>Polygon</strong> is a <strong>layer-2 chain</strong> that brings costs down to a few cents per minted NFT and works fast as well. It is directly compatible with Ethereum, so it is easy for apps to integrate (and many have). The largest marketplaces (like OpenSea) support Polygon.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nftport.xyz/blog/nft-minting-with-rest-api">NFTport</a> supports both Etherium and Polygon.


<a name="SmartContracts"></a>

## Smart Contracts

Blockchain technology also enables the addition of rules (code) in "smart contracts" that are automatically invoked (enforced) when predefined conditions are met.
Such self-executing contracts operate without the need for intermediaries.

Smart contracts are like rules (covenants) added to real estate property deeds processed by escrow agents.

Smart contracts can limit resell such as the amount of commission returned to the orginal artist each time the artwork is transferred.

The Solidity curly-bracketed programming language (to define classes and functions) is commonly used for this purpose, using the <a target="_blank" href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">https://remix.ethereum.org online IDE</a>.
See https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Wallet {
   constructor() public {
   }
   function getResult() public view returns (uint) {
      uint a = 2;
      uint b = 3;
      return a + b;
   }
   uint256 public balance;
   function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
      balance += amount;
   }
   function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
      balance -= amount;
   }
}
```
Smart contracts are coded in ".sol" (Solidity) files run in the decentralized virtual environment <a target="_blank" href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM (Etherium Virtual Machine)</a>.

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web3-smart-contracts/">"A Tour of Web 3: Ethereum & Smart Contracts with Solidity"</a> 4-hour course by ThePrimeagen

EVMs use "gas" to measure the computational effort required for operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network security.

CAUTION: Development of smart contracts requires absolute correctness. So testing by professionals is crucial.
Thus, pro testers are needed.

<a href="#CryptoWallet"></a>

## Cryptocurrency Wallets

To create an NFT and sell it online, you first need a crypto wallet linked to a compatible blockchain.
Then you can pick a suitable marketplace, upload your file to “mint” your NFT, and list it for sale.

associated with a token stored on a NFT marketplace.

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/">Metamask's SDK</a>
support for libraries <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/3rd-party-libraries/wagmi/">Wagmi</a>
or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/3rd-party-libraries/web3-onboard/">Web3-Onboard</a>.

Marketplaces charge royalty fees to reward the NFT creator if their NFT is resold.
The percentage of the royalty changes depending on the marketplace. Royalties can be from 5% to as high as 50%.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital asset with markers that make it unique through the use of blockchain technology.

Human beings naturally find rare objects valuable, and NFTs guarantee authenticity and ownership, making them rare, useful as status symbols, and convertible to cash via cryptocurrency. After NFTs are put on a blockchain, which acts as a digital ledger, they can't be copied.

<a target="_blank" href="https://xrpl.org/docs/introduction/what-is-xrp">XRP Ledger</a>
https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/python/nfts/mint-and-burn-nfts


<a name="Marketplaces"></a>

A token is the item's information hashed into an alphanumeric string.
This token is stored on the blockchain and establishes ownership of a digital item.

 ??? ownable by only one person at a time.



he token itself is hashed information stored on the blockchain. The digital item, tagged with metadata, is stored somewhere else, like Amazon Web Services or another hosting service. This is why you can right-click on the picture on an NFT auction site and save it—it is only the image. But your copy does not have the data associated with the NFT, so you're not the owner. In a sense, you have a forged copy.

1. Run hardhat to compile, test, deploy, and interact with your NFT smart contract.




1. Faucet

   The Google Cloud faucet provides web3 developers with free tokens for deploying, testing, and optimizing smart contracts on popular testnets like Holesky and Sepolia. A faucet is an app that dispenses free tokens on a testnet for experimentation, such as deploying smart contracts or debugging transactions.
   Testnet tokens have no real-world value and cannot be sold or used on the main blockchain network (like Ethereum mainnet).

   If you're curious, you can track the transaction's status using a blockchain explorer or an RPC endpoint for that specific testnet.
