When, in 2024, Anthropic.com released https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol,
the technology was called the "hottest thing ever in tech":

<ul>"MCP" (Model Context Protocol) and "AI Agents"</ul>

Standardization of how MCP communicates with AI Agents has made it easier for 
thousands of MCP servers and AI Agents to be created each day and appear in MCP Catalogs:
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://mcp.so">https://mcp.so</a>
   <br /><br />

More importantly, the "Agentic AI" vision includes a future where AI Agents can reason and <strong>autonomously</strong> take action not just moving a cursor, filling forms, and coding, but also automate do research, perform entire workflows as physical and virtual robots.​

Dozens of YouTube videos offer conceptual tutorials with flowcharts:

   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2DEHOEbzks "How MCP Works" by the author of KodeKloud.com
   <br /><br />
In this article, let's get you <strong>hands-on</strong> using the "Official <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Learn</a> MCP Server" loaded with what Microsoft previously displayed on their marketing, documentation, and tutorial websites, so that users can hold <strong>natural language</strong> conversations like with OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

<ul><tt><strong>https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp</strong></tt></ul>

Sample prompts are presented after we cover installation of MCP Clients on your laptop.

1. Highlight and copy the above URL to your machine's Clipboard so you can paste it into an internet browser Address field.
   * If you use the Safari browser, it would try to download a file "mcp". So...
   * If you use the Chrome, Firefox, or Brave browser, you would see a message returned as a convenience to humans:

   <tt>"This is an MCP server endpoint and cannot be accessed directly via a browser or unsupported transports like SSE. Please use a streamable HTTP transport. For more details, visit: https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mcp.</tt>

   The website referenced: "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp" does not provide step-by-step instructions to actually make use of their MCP Server.

   Here, we do. 

   DEFINITION: "streamable HTTP transport" refers to the MCP standard specifying that, unlike websites which return <strong>HTML</strong>, MCP Servers use gRPC (Remote Procedure calls) and SSE (Server Sent Events) for remote and "stdio" for local communication.

   ## MCP Clients

   An MCP client usually needs to be installed to handle those technologies:
   Each of these categories have a different way to install:

   * Stand-alone apps such as <a href="#WarpCLI">Warp CLI</a>, Claude Desktop, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Copilot Studio, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, etc.
   * Stand-alone IDE such as Winsurf, PyCharm
   * Extensions added to IDE VSCode, such as Cursor.
   * Stand-alone utilities such as <a href="#MCPInspector"><strong>MCP Inspector</strong></a> for a deep-dive into the "JSON-RPC over HTTP or stdio" protocol used by MCP.
   * Web servers such as NodeJs 
   <br /><br />

   The exception is <a href="#curl"><tt>curl</tt> command within the Terminal that comes with macOS.

   Click on a link in the list above for install and run instructions.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/tools/ and
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/connect-agent-to-mcp-tools/?source=recommendations
describes how "Azure MCP Server tools" answers questions such as:
   * "Show me all my resource groups"
   * "List blobs in my storage container named 'documents'"
   * "What's the value of the 'ConnectionString' key in my app configuration?"
   * "Query my log analytics workspace for errors in the last hour"
   * "Show me all my Cosmos DB databases"

<a name="curl"></a>

### curl

Paste this command to execute the curl utility command:
   ```
   curl -X POST https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: text/event-stream, application/json" \
    -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "test-1234",
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
           "name": "microsoft_docs_search",
           "arguments": {
              "query": "Who uses MCP"
        }
        }
     }' | grep '^data:' | sed 's/^data: //' \
     | jq -r '.result.content[].text' | jq -r '.[] | .content' \
     > mcp-ms-learn.md
     brew install glow
     glow mcp-ms-learn.md
   ```
   More about Bash coding parameters in the above command:

   <tt>-X POST<tt> defines the MCP Server endpoint.

   <tt>-H "Content-Type: application/json</tt> is required for JSON-RPC compliance.

   <tt>-H "Accept: text/event-stream, application/json</tt> defined in<br />
   <tt>-d '{ ... }'</tt> defines a JSON body defining the RPC method and parameters.

   <tt>"jsonrpc": "2.0"</tt> uses the "JSON-RPC version 2" protocol (which operates over HTTP POST).

   <tt>"method": "tools/call"</tt> — Invokes a tool defined by the MCP server.

   "params.name" — The name of the tool Microsoft defined, and<br />
   "params.arguments" — Key–value pairs of arguments specific to the selected tool.

   <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1">
   <tr><th>Tool Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Input Parameters</th></tr>
   <tr valign="top"><td><tt>"microsoft_docs_search"</tt></td><td>Performs semantic search against Microsoft official technical documentation

### Warp CLI


Warp.dev is my favorite AI assistant.

1. Open Warp.app
1. At the same time, press command + comma for the Settings GUI.

   Go to Warp's MCP Server settings via: Warp Drive > Personal > MCP Servers.
   Command Palette: search "Open MCP Servers"

1. Click "AI" menu.
1. Scroll down to click "Manage MCP Servers".
1. Click "+ Add" to add a new MCP server.
   ```
   {
    "": {
        "command": "",
        "args": [],
        "env": {},
        "working_directory": null
        }
    }
   ```
   PROTIP: The JSON configuration enables you to define multiple servers in one go.​

   (Optional) Add environment variables or a working directory if your server needs them.

   Choose the server type:
   * CLI Server: Provide a command (like npx) and its arguments (for Node.js or other servers).
   * SSE Server: Provide a URL for an HTTP endpoint that supports Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Install and use MCP within VS Code

Since most developers already have Visual Studio Code, let's add an MCP server to it:

1. In VSCode, open the Command Palette
   * Press at the same time: Shift + Command + P
   * Click the settings icon at the lower-left to select "Command Pallete".
1. Ignore the ">" and type enough of <tt>MCP: Add Server</tt> to select it.
1. Choose the server type (HTTP/SSE (Server Sent Events) for remote, stdio for local).
1. Enter the server URL 

   https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp

1. ??? Provide a Server ID, and select whether to save in workspace or user settings.
1. ??? Configure authentication (e.g., add your API key to headers in .vscode/mcp.json or settings.json).

Ensure you send the required authentication headers (often an API key or OAuth token).​

## Build Custom MCP Servers

Build your own MCP server using any supported language — MCP just requires 

For .NET or Node.js, sample server-side packages are available.



You can define tools and expose them dynamically for LLMs to consume, optionally supporting authentication, prompts, and tool-specific parameters.​

## Install and use MCP Inspector utility

   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnk80CnhQB4&t=43s by Euron, using Powrshell VSCode uv add "mcp[cli]" to define a program usinf fastmcp library


Documentation about the tool is at:

"The Inspector runs directly through npx without requiring installation"
