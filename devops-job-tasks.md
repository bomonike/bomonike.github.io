Most job descriptons for DevOps roles focus on vendor <strong>product offerings</strong> (GitHub, Jenkins, etc.).

However, <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/devops-job-tasks/">this page</a> lists the contributions, achievements, and outcomes from working DevOps (DevTestSecOps or DevXOps), based on Job Task Analysis.

In <a href="#MyRadar">my radar chart below</a>:

The <strong>red</strong> line shows the desired profile for a <strong>Senior DevOps Engineer</strong>.
Other jobs would have a different profile.

## My DevOps Skills Radar Chart

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1752978757/DevOpsSkillsRadarChart_o6rlww.png"><img alt="DevOpsSkillsRadarChart.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1752978757/DevOpsSkillsRadarChart_o6rlww.png" /><em>Click for full screen</em></a>

WARNING: Are the ratings <strong>realistic</strong> or too ambitious?

For both the red and blue lines, the further a point is from the center, the more maturity is noted:

&nbsp; 1. Novice / 2. Competent / 3. Proficient / 4. Expert / 5. Master

1. <strong>Novice</strong> describes the beginning stage where someone has little to no experience with a skill or domain. Novices typically rely heavily on <strong>rules, guidelines, and step-by-step instructions</strong>. They lack the contextual understanding to know when rules should be bent or broken, and they need significant guidance and supervision. Their performance is often rigid and focused on following procedures correctly rather than achieving optimal outcomes.

1. <strong>Competent</strong> describes someone who has gained enough experience to start making conscious choices about their actions. They <strong>can prioritize</strong> tasks, plan ahead, and have developed some personal attachment to their outcomes. Competent practitioners can handle routine situations <strong>independently</strong> but may struggle with unexpected complications. They're beginning to <strong>see patterns</strong> and can adapt their approach based on experience, though they still rely on analytical thinking more than intuition.

1. <strong>Proficient</strong> individuals have developed a more fluid, intuitive grasp of their domain. They can see situations <strong>holistically</strong> rather than just as a collection of parts, and they recognize patterns quickly. Proficient practitioners know what's important in various situations and can focus their attention accordingly. They've moved beyond rigid rule-following to understanding the <strong>deeper principles</strong> underlying their field, allowing for more flexible and context-appropriate responses.

1. <strong>Expert</strong> level represents highly developed intuitive understanding combined with extensive <strong>analytical</strong> ability when needed. Experts have a vast repertoire of experienced situations to draw from and can quickly identify what's most <strong>relevant</strong> in new circumstances. They operate fluidly and efficiently, often making <strong>complex decisions</strong> that appear effortless to observers. Experts can handle novel situations by drawing analogies to their deep experience base and can often sense when something isn't right even before they can articulate why.

1. <strong>Master</strong> goes beyond individual expertise to encompass <strong>wisdom</strong>, innovation, and the ability to guide others' development. Masters not only perform at the highest level but can also break new ground in their field, <strong>create new methods</strong> or understanding, and effectively <strong>teach and mentor</strong> others. They possess both deep technical knowledge and the broader perspective to see how their domain connects to larger contexts and purposes.

## Categories for technology management

A <strong>dashboard</strong> displaying progress toward DevOps implementation would instead be grouped by <strong>categories of technology</strong>:

A. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Security">Security</a><br />
B. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Networks">Networks</a><br />
C. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Persistance">Persistance</a> (storage, databases)<br />
D. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Compute">Compute</a> (virtual machines)<br />
E. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Management">Management</a> (monitoring)<br />
F. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#DevOps">DevOps</a> (development to operations)<br />
G. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Integration">Integration</a> (messaging)<br />
H. <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-services-comparisons/#Analytics">Analytics</a> (BI, Visualization, Machine Learning & AI)<br />

The above list is often used to also define organizational boundaries, where technicians report to a manager in charge of each category (such as the department of Networking, etc.). The concern with such an approach is that each category is dependent on others to be setup at the same time. Each of the above needs to be a part of each application.

But traditional enterprise communication tends to be funneled up through category managers rather than directly among workers. 

"Agile" teams aim to put skills that address ALL categories into each small team. That's a tall order considering the staggering number of technologies implemented, especially in companies which have relegated each employee to a very specific role for years and don't make it easy to hold a job which spans all these categories, even in the course of an entire 40-year career.

Here is where culture, collaboration tools, and automation may help.

PROTIP: The hope is that, eventually, advances in <strong>automation</strong> would enable small Agile teams to work like a start-up on their own, addressing all aspects of a traditional data center without ceremonies to get permission and clearance through various management ranks. So the futuristic view of the job tasks below would be how to get a computer to do each on its own with minimal human interaction.

But, for now, people are involved in its setup, configuration, and maintenance, so they need to learn the <strong>specific skills</strong> below, both manually in the GUI and in automation scripts such as Bash, Python, PowerShell, and other scripts.

## Areas of Skills and Knowledge

Different organizations have organized what "DevOps" professionals need to know and do:

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/63094616-2f9d2100-bf26-11e9-9c67-c61977f31620.png"><img alt="devops-dasa-model-800x800" width="800" height="800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/63094616-2f9d2100-bf26-11e9-9c67-c61977f31620.png"></a>

The above is from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/dasa-devops-principles/">6 principles of DevOps</a> at DASA (DevOps Compentence Association). It has a <a target="_blank" href="https://scan.devopsagileskills.org/">24 question QuickScan</a> for individuals to self-assess their own level in each of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/dasa-competence-model/">12 (4 skill areas and 8 knowledge areas) in the DevOps Compentence Model</a>, with levels at 1. Novice / 2. Competent / 3. Proficient / 4. Expert / 5. Master.

There are several organizations providing (overlapping) certification exams and training based on DevOps.

To develop and validate those skills, DASA provides 7 exams in their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/certifications/">DASA certification scheme</a> implemented by <a target="_blank" href="https://isqi.org/us/en/">iSQLI</a> (which also handles ISQTB QA, Lean Six Sigma, and other certifications).

PROTIP: Questions in the QuickScan contain statements about what each person can actually do to reach the highest levels in each area (such as being proactive vs. reactive, on a daily basis, inside and outside the organization, etc.). These statements are gold because they make the DevOps journey real. Make an appointment with yourself to review these statements once a week to document <strong>proof</strong> of how you personally are achieving them.
