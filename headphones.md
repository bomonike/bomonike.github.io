Here are my notes on choosing and configuring headphones.

Why? I've cancelled flights if I don't have a noise-cancelling headphone on the flight.

In-ear headphones is painful in my ear.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5qootmFQx0">Mike O'Brien's</a> ANC test showed Bose QuietComfort Ultra the best at blocking aircraft jet humm, with AirPods Max coming in 2nd at 60 dB.



## Apple Airpods Max

The reason I wear it is the <strong>automatic switching</strong>
among different Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook).
That's even though it's heavier (386 grams)
and doesn't support Lossless playback.

1. With $549 MSRP at Costco it's the most expense headphones.

   Its sound quality is weaker than others.

1. Charge up the headset using a Lightning cable like on older iPhones.
   The Max 2 announced in 2024 has USB-C charging.
   * Amber light appears below 95%
   * Green light appears above 95%

   It's rated for 30 hours between charges.

1. The "case" is used to power down the headphone.
   Strangely, there is no power ON/OFF button on the Apple headset.
