In <a href="#MyRadar">my radar chart below</a>:

The <strong>red</strong> line above shows the desired profile for a <strong>Senior DevOps Engineer</strong>.
Other jobs would have a different profile.

For both the red and blue lines, the further a point is from the center, the more skill is noted:

\1. Novice / 2. Competent / 3. Proficient / 4. Expert / 5. Master

1. <strong>Novice</strong> represents the beginning stage where someone has little to no experience with a skill or domain. Novices typically rely heavily on rules, guidelines, and step-by-step instructions. They lack the contextual understanding to know when rules should be bent or broken, and they need significant guidance and supervision. Their performance is often rigid and focused on following procedures correctly rather than achieving optimal outcomes.

1. <strong>Competent</strong> describes someone who has gained enough experience to start making conscious choices about their actions. They can prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and have developed some personal attachment to their outcomes. Competent practitioners can handle routine situations independently but may struggle with unexpected complications. They're beginning to see patterns and can adapt their approach based on experience, though they still rely on analytical thinking more than intuition.

1. <strong>Proficient</strong> individuals have developed a more fluid, intuitive grasp of their domain. They can see situations holistically rather than just as a collection of parts, and they recognize patterns quickly. Proficient practitioners know what's important in various situations and can focus their attention accordingly. They've moved beyond rigid rule-following to understanding the deeper principles underlying their field, allowing for more flexible and context-appropriate responses.

1. <strong>Expert</strong> level represents highly developed intuitive understanding combined with extensive analytical ability when needed. Experts have a vast repertoire of experienced situations to draw from and can quickly identify what's most relevant in new circumstances. They operate fluidly and efficiently, often making complex decisions that appear effortless to observers. Experts can handle novel situations by drawing analogies to their deep experience base and can often sense when something isn't right even before they can articulate why.

1. <strong>Master</strong> goes beyond individual expertise to encompass wisdom, innovation, and the ability to guide others' development. Masters not only perform at the highest level but can also break new ground in their field, create new methods or understanding, and effectively teach and mentor others. They possess both deep technical knowledge and the broader perspective to see how their domain connects to larger contexts and purposes.
<br /><br />

The <strong>blue</strong> line showing ratings for "Your profile" above is hypothetical.

The <strong>gap</strong> is the work needed to close the gap.

## Areas of Skills and Knowledge

Different organizations have organized what "DevOps" professionals need to know and do:

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/63094616-2f9d2100-bf26-11e9-9c67-c61977f31620.png"><img alt="devops-dasa-model-800x800" width="800" height="800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/63094616-2f9d2100-bf26-11e9-9c67-c61977f31620.png"></a>

The above is from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/dasa-devops-principles/">6 principles of DevOps</a> at DASA (DevOps Compentence Association). It has a <a target="_blank" href="https://scan.devopsagileskills.org/">24 question QuickScan</a> for individuals to self-assess their own level in each of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/dasa-competence-model/">12 (4 skill areas and 8 knowledge areas) in the DevOps Compentence Model</a>, with levels at 1. Novice / 2. Competent / 3. Proficient / 4. Expert / 5. Master.

There are several organizations providing (overlapping) certification exams and training based on DevOps.

To develop and validate those skills, DASA provides 7 exams in their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devopsagileskills.org/certifications/">DASA certification scheme</a> implemented by <a target="_blank" href="https://isqi.org/us/en/">iSQLI</a> (which also handles ISQTB QA, Lean Six Sigma, and other certifications).

PROTIP: Questions in the QuickScan contain statements about what each person can actually do to reach the highest levels in each area (such as being proactive vs. reactive, on a daily basis, inside and outside the organization, etc.). These statements are gold because they make the DevOps journey real. Make an appointment with yourself to review these statements once a week to document <strong>proof</strong> of how you personally are achieving them.

DAST cannot identify non-reflective vulnerabilities (i.e – Cross-Site Scripting) that don’t generate feedback when triggered.
