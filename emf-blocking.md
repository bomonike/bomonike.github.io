Reduce your exposure to potentially harmful <strong>EMFs (ElectroMagnetic Fields)</strong> emitted from your favorite tech.

1. Microwave ovens: Move several feet away to reduce exposure to radiation. Such instructions are usually included in the oven’s manual.

   Microwaves are so powerful that they cook food. It's used to transmit signals hundreds of miles.

1. Wi-Fi router: connect to a reacheable power switch so you can easily shut off them off at night.

1. Cell phones: avoid holding them up to your ear like a land-line phone.

   Instead, use the speaker phone and keep the phone at a distance from your head.

1. Cell phones: Switch to <strong>airplane mode</strong> when carrying them in your pocket.

1. Touch-screen tablets: <strong>Use a Stylus Pen</strong> instead of using your finger.

   When your fingers touch your phone or tablet’s screen, you are receiving more radiation that what is currently considered "safe" under FCC radiation regulations.

1. Laptops: Do not place them on your lap. Get a remote keyboard to the screen on a nearby table.

1. Block heat and EMF from the bottom of your laptop by resting it on top the rubberized <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPY41ZU/">$116.99 DefenderPad</a> (it's 17").

1. Charge cell phones and digital devices outside of the bedroom during sleep.

   A high EMF field is produced while charging.

1. Alarm clocks: use battery operated rather than corded clocks.

   Corded alarm clocks produce high amounts of EMFs.

1. Beds: place your bed so your head is as far away as possible from electrical breaker boxes.

1. Appliances and electronics such as microwave ovens and TVs: cut off power to them when not using them.

   Appliances give off EMF even after being shut down.

1. Electric blankets: use them only to pre-heat the bed. But while you sleep, turn them off and unplug the blanket.

1. Do your best to remove electronics from the bedrooms and nurseries. Only keep in sleeping areas electronic items that are absolutely necessary.

1. Go wired whenever possible. Use wired connections for internet and for making phone calls.
