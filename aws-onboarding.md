<a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/aws-onboarding/">
This</a> is a hands-on tutorial to get new users setup to effectively access and use the AWS cloud - without tedious "talking head" lectures. Here you do some action and explanations. "PROTIP" tags highlight my advice, found in few other places.

Covered here are instructions on how to install and use AWS CLI automation, smart phone apps, and 3rd party tools used by pros.


<a name="KPI"></a>

## Better KPI values for onboarding

"PROTIP" Recommendations in this article are intended to improve these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of an organization:

What is the max/average hours that:

A. each <strong>Administrators</strong> to get accounts and a laptop ready for receipt by a new team member?

A1. each Administrator needs to spend between receiving instructions to get an AWS account ready for use by an end-user?

B. each <strong>end-user</strong> needs to spend from receiving a laptop to being completely productive (create and file a Git PR)?

B1. each end-user needs to spend between receiving instructions to being completely productive on AWS?

PROTIP: CAUTION: Using speed as the primary basis for judging performance can lead to cutting corners and thus security holes. So security must be a primary consideration. But security is difficult to measure.



## AWS Marketing Page

1. Use an internet browser to get on the <strong>AWS marketing page</strong> at 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com</a> 

1. Explore its menu items:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><img alt="aws-landing-menu.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1769154950/aws-landing-menu_e8io6g.png"></a>
   <!-- aws-marketing-1205x224_uaojtf.png -->

   PROTIP: Right-click on each link to "open in a new tab". Then quickly switch back and forth between this tutorial and other browser tabs by pressing <strong>Command+`</strong> (backtick at the left of the 1 key). However, tabs set to full-screen are not accessible this way but by pressing shift+command+/ to see the menu to select the tab you want to switch to.

   "My account" consists of:
   * AWS Management Console
   * Account Settings
   * Billing & Cost Management
   * Security Credentials
   * AWS Personal Health Dashboard
   <br /><br />
   "Support" consists of:
   * Support Center
   * Expert Help
   * Documentation
   * Knowledge Center
   * AWS Support Overview
   * AWS re:Post

1. Set a <strong>bookmark</strong> this page in your browser for quicker frequent access. 


   <a name="Preparations"></a>

   ## Preparations for highly secure use of AWS

1. Prepare for secure use of AWS:

   Get in the habit of working like James Bond, so you can brag about that at interviews:

   1. Can a <strong>Chromebook</strong> with a relatively small amount of RAM and data storage be used to access AWS? YES!

      AWS (Amazon Web Services) runs in Amazon's data centers to provide on-demand access to computing resources, including servers, storage, databases, and analytics tools.

      However, Amazon provides its "Outpost" service for its enterprise customers to use a modified form of AWS commands and services on <strong>servers</strong> those enterprises maintain on their own premises.

      Either way, a Chromebook can be used to control AWS resources. However, a powerful laptop is useful to hold larger files and process them locally, perhaps off-line.

      <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/appstream-chrome-chromebook-support/">The AWS Appstream app</a> is used to display streaming content (like Netflix and YouTube).

   1. On a trusted computer, establish a personal <strong>password manager</strong> (digital vault) for storing passwords and other sensitive information.

   1. Store your password manager vault file on a password-protected <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geckoandfly.com/21463/usb-password-protect-lock-encrypt-flash-drive/">removeable USB drive that has brute-force protection</a>. If the Admin PIN is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row, brute force attack protection triggers a crypto-erase of the drive. 

      Linux users scared of PC Keyboard Loggers can get the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kingston.com/en/usb-flash-drives/ironkey-kp200-encrypted-usb-flash-drive">Kingston Ironkey 200 32GB with a built-in battery-operated PIN pad</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF9KBHNR/">$136 from Amazon</a>.

   1. When you're on a trusted computer, <strong>backup</strong> a copy of your secrets to keep in a safe place (fireproof & EMP-proof safe, etc.). 

      Windows and MacOS users can use, for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5B2WL5R/?th=1">$37.99 on Amazon</a>, the Kingston Ironkey Locker+ 50 32GB provides automatic cloud backup (if you trust Kingston). It needs a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Anker-High-Speed-Transfer-Notebook/dp/B08HZ6PS61/">USB-A to USB-C adapter</a>.

   1. Configure your computer to use Quad9.net DNS (at address 9.9.9.9) so known malicious websites are blocked automatically.

   1. Install and use the Google Chrome browser so each Google email is setup within a different <strong>browser profile</strong>. Each profle holds its own preferences, browse history, and cookies for the specific email account.

   1. So you can ignore phishing attempts to common email domains and powned email addresses, <strong>create different emails</strong> for social media, professional, and governmental/banking activities. Use protonmail.com now that gmail.com is no longer cool.

   1. Use your <strong>personal professional email address</strong> (such as "johndoe@proton.me") when creating a personal AWS "Skill Builder" account at <a target="_blank" href="https://skillbuilder.aws">https://skillbuilder.aws</a>  which links to your AWS certifications for life. NOTE: Additional accounts & passwords are used for Amazon marketplaces, AWS Events, and AWS cloud work.

   1. On your mobile phone, install app <a target="_blank" href="https://www.authy.com/">Authy (from Twilio)</a> for MFA (Multi-Facator Authentication) which can be restored on new phones if you lose your phone.

   1. Secure each account with <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> (MFA), with recovery codes saved as secrets in the Password Manager.

## Ways to interact with AWS:

Console GUI, CLI, API, IoC, Mobile:

* <strong>Visually</strong> clicking and typing on the internet browser "<strong>AWS Management Console</strong>"</a> at <tt>https://console.aws.amazon.com/</tt>. It's used during initial setup to <a href="#RootCredentials">create and configure</a>, then <a href="#RootLockDown">lock down</a> a <a href="#RootCredentials">Root Account</a>. Authentication is by user name and password plus MFA.

* <strong>Textually</strong> typing in the <strong>CLI</strong> (Command Line Interface)</a> provided by the MacOS/Linux Terminal or Windows PC Command (cmd) utility. The AWS CLI program is installed for <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/aws-cli/"><tt>az</tt> commands</a> to be executed interactively or within interpretive Bash scripts scheduled in batch jobs. Authentication is by <tt>aws configure</tt> command which stores credentials in an unencrypted file at <tt>~/.aws/credentials</tt>.

* <strong>Programmatically</strong> running custom program code (such as Pyyhon, JavaScript, etc.) which call AWS APIs (Application Programming Interface) called by custom programs calling <a href="#APIKeys">AWS's API (Application Programming Interface)</a>. Amazon's Boto3 SDK and Pulumi.com use this approach. This is the mechanism behind the scenes by <a href="#MobileApps">mobile apps</a>. Authentication is by including APIKeys generated by AWS.

* <strong>Declaratively</strong> running Infrastructure as Code (IoC) DSL (Domain Specific Language) definitions to define the <strong>desired state</strong> of the AWS environment. This makes it easier to track changes and repeat the same environment in different regions and accounts. This also makes it possible to evaluate the vulnerabilities and costs of an environment even before it is created. Authentication is by including APIKeys generated by AWS. <a target="_blank" href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-alternatives">Alternatives for IoC</a> on AWS include AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, Hashicorp CDKTF, <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/terraform/">Hashicorp Terraform</a> directed acyclic graphs, OpenTofu, <a target="_blank" href="https://spacelift.io/customers/affinity">Spacelift</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firefly.ai/academy/terraform-alternatives">Firefly</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://scalr.com/learning-center/terraform-alternatives-checklist-before-switching/">Scalr cloud</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/ansible/">Red Hat Ansible</a>, Crossplane (inside K8s clusters), <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot">SkyPilot</a> (GPUs), etc. Some of these are able to use <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/opa/">Open Policy Agents (OPA)</a> to define and enforce policies for security, accurate billing, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTEgE2lcyk4&t=1332s

* <strong>Visibly</strong> reading from <a href="#MobileApps">AWS Console Mobile app</a> month-to-date costs, CloudWatch alarms triggered, and AWS Health issues identified.

SECURITY PROTIP: Many enterprises do not permit use of interactive CLI and Console GUI in production and instead allow only automated API calls by IaC (such as CloudFormation and Terraform). This is to ensure version control and repeatability during testing.

<a name="TypesOfAccounts"></a>
   
## Types of accounts to sign-up for

1. PROTIP: There are several different sign-up pages: one for each country and type of user: 

   * If you want to create a stand-alone account in the US, click the "Sign up" button:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register">https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register</a> (<a href="#StandAloneAccount">see below</a>)
   * If you want to create a stand-alone account in China: ???
   * If you're a student or educator with an ".edu" email:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/</a>
   * If you're working with an AWS salesperson assigned to a business:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/">https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/</a>
   * If you're using a gov (US government) cloud:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/government/">https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/government/</a>
   <br /><br />

<hr />

## AWS Free Tier

Since July 15, 2025, new AWS accounts are given 6 months (rather than a year) of free access to some AWS services.

Each new AWS account receives up to $200 in AWS Free Tier credits, which can be applied towards eligible AWS services, such as AWS Amplify websites. 

All Free Tier credits must be used within 12 months of your account creation date. To learn more about the AWS Free Tier program, refer to AWS Free Tier website and AWS Free Tier documentation.

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>

<a name="AWS_profile"></a>

## AWS Profile

These are steps to create a stand-alone root account.

1. Create a new email address for your AWS account.
1. In your Password Manager app (such as KeepassXC), create a new entry to store the email, Account Name, password, Account ID, Secret info.
1. If you don't have Google Chrome installed, install it.
1. Open a Google Chrome app.
1. Click the person icon at the upper-right corner and sign in using your personal AWS "Skill Builder" profile email address.

<a name="StandAloneAccount"></a>

## Stand-alone root account setup

These are steps to create a stand-alone root account.

1. Click the "Create Account" button.


1. At <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>, click "Create Account" at the top-right corner.
1. 


1. For "AWS account name", examples are "master-billing" but the email works too.
1. Switch to your email tab to click the link to verify your email address.
1. PROTIP: When providing answers to Security Challenge Questions, do not specify the real answer,
   which someone stole or figured out through social engineering. Instead, <strong>answer with nonsense</strong>

1. Write that secret information down in 1Password or a paper in your fire-proof vault.
1. Write down your <strong>Account Id</strong> number (12 digits).

5. Supply a strong password.

   PROTIP: Use 1Password so that you can easily generate up to <strong>64 character</strong> password, but remember only one password to access the 1Password database of secrets. 1Password encrypts its database so that you can make backups (to a USB drive or secure cloud). I favor 1Password because it provides a way to sync changes with your smartphone without going through the internet.

   Because you only have to remember one master password, you can are free to change various passwords as often as you want with no fear of forgetting them.

7. Click "Continue".

   If you have 1Password installed, you would be prompted to create a new account.

1. Provide phone number.

   PROTIP: If you provide a Google Voice virtual number, it would be less of a hassle in case you change the actual number of your phone assigned by your carrier. So in case you change phone vendors (from ATT to T-Mobile), you only need to change it in Google Voice.




<a name="RootCredentials"></a>

## Unique restricted email for God-Mode Global Admin Root account
   
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-sign-in-experience/"><img align="right" width="210" alt="aws-signup-root-315x150.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1769154720/aws-signup-root-315x150_elpgcs.png" /></a>
   The email provided for "Sign up" is called the "Root" account "for account recovery".

   WARNING: By default, permissions for a <strong>"Global Adminstrators" group</strong> is granted to the email used to create the root account. The Global Adminstrators group has <strong>unlimited access</strong> to do anything to all AWS resources under the account and thus unlimited ability to rack up charges (legitimate or otherwise). By resources I mean: users, groups, roles, IAM Access Policies, API keys, etc. globally for all regions.

   ## Separation of Duties and Concerns

1. PROTIP: To follow Separation of Duties (SoD) principles, the account should be owned only by a company's Accounts Payable department under the corporation's Controller and not by operational or IT staff. this should be announced by a corporate office as company policy.

1. In an enterprise when several people or departments are involved, create a sub-account for use with each level of processing, to provide individual traceability and accountability.

1. A Global Adminstrators creates a set of <strong>sub-accounts</strong> and do not use the root account again except for emergency purposes.
   
   It's common for a separate account to be created for each <strong>department</strong> and <strong>project</strong> as well as each <strong>user</strong>. This is to limit the "blast radius" when an account's credentials become compromised, a situation we need to prepare for.

   CAUTION: Do not use email address used for AWS to also be used in social media.
   Emails used for managing AWS production accounts <strong>should be used only for managing AWS</strong> and not for regular email use, social media, and shopping.

1. AWS customers create and use a different AWS account for each environment (development, testing, training, production, migration, etc.). IaC (Infrastructure as Code) allows resource configurations and statuses to be compared across multiple accounts for troubleshooting application issues. 

1. PROTIP: Passage of access responsibility should be recorded with time stamps and signatures of the parties involved, with a witness present.
   



<a name="EmailSystem"></a>

## Auto-Generate Emails with Responders

PROTIP: Create a new AWS account for at the free tier for <strong>one year</strong>.

PROTIP: Add a calendar entry.

Global Administrators can reduce time and hassle that both they themselves and their end-users (internal customers) by doing ALL AWS account setup tasks rather than giving a long list of instructions for end-users to follow (as shown below), then providing support to those who won't or don't follow instructions. This is especially true for those who are "not technical". This means automation of email creation and also having automation impersonate each user's email for verification of AWS account, GitHub, etc.

PROTIP: <strong>Use a separate email address for each AWS account</strong> you create.
Global Administrators working with AWS need to have admin control of an email system to create email accounts and (automatically) read/answer sample user emails.

   * Individual learners need to generate several email accounts to take advantage of "Free Tier" that only lasts a year each. AWS learners need to create their own account to not disturb corporate work.

   * Corporate Global Administrators need to generate emails for each new employees who join. 

   * PROTIP: To prevent destructive hacking, a separate account should be created with permissions to delete important data in production. Other standar accounts should not be able to delete production files. The person using this account should have the feduciary responsibility to ensure a full backup is confirmed before performing deletes. 

Within an organization, it's common for a separate account to be created for each department and project as well as each user. This is to limit the blast radius when a user's credentials become compromised, a situation we need to prepare for.


### Unique Browser Profile for Each Email

1. Install Google Chrome because it has detection of malicious conditions.
1. You will have several gmail addresses, one for each AWS account you create.
1. To avoid confusion between Google accounts, install the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-login-helper/nccllfnllopfpcbjdgjdlfmomnfgnnbk">Multi Login Helper</a> extension to create a new browser profile for each AWS account you create. 

   PROTIP: The Multi Login Helper extension is also useful for creating a new browser profile for each Google account you have.
   

Only the Google Chrome browser supports <a target="_blank" href="[#ChromeExtension](https://towardsdev.com/managing-multi-session-aws-managed-console-with-the-aws-extend-switch-roles-chrome-extension-e2b8255e2163)">installation</a> of the simultaneous sign-in multiple AWS accounts in the AWS Management Console GUI. This "Multi-Session" feature can be used to switch between for up to 5 AWS accounts, each in a different browser tab, each tab managed independently with unique credentials and other context. The feature was added <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/aws-management-console-simultaneous-sign-in-multiple-accounts/">Jan 16, 2025</a> in all Commercial Regions. 

   1. Install the extension by visiting the <a target="_blank" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aws-extend-switch-roles/jpmkfafbacpgapdghgdpembnojdlgkdl">AWS Extend Switch Roles Chrome Extension</a> page.
   1. Click to "Enable it".
   1. In CLI, set the configuration using command <tt>aws config format</tt> ???
   1. Open a new browser tab for each account. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/multisession.html
   1. Use the command+' key combination to switch among tabs.
   1. When a tab group is removed, the corresponding session will be automatically signed out.



   <a name="ComparePlans"></a>

   ### Compare Support Plans

   https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/home/contact?SourceApp=smcivr2

1. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/plans/home?#/">Amazon's Support Plan page here</a>.

   Admins call (800) 865-9408 or (800) 642 7676 (toll-free, US only). Outside the United States, see <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/global-customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2">global support phone numbers</a>.

   The Basic account does not enable you to communicate with Amazon people who can answer technical questions.

   The $29/month Developer Plan enables you to open an unlimited number of support cases
   only via email, with a 12-hour response time if "system impaired". Otherwise, the SLA
   is 24 hours.

   The $100/month Business Plan enables you to have 24/7 chat, phone, as well as email access with AWS Support people on an unlimited number of support cases, with a 1-hour response time for "production down" issues, or 4-hour response for "production impaired" issues.

   Amazon's <strong>Enterprise Plan</strong> for $15,000/month gets you 15 minute response on "business critical system down" issues. This plan also comes with an assigned TAM (Technical Account Manager).

   These dollar amounts are minimums, not fixed prices.

   https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/programs/iem/
   mentions "AWS Infrastructure Event Management (IEM) offers architecture and scaling guidance and operational support during the preparation and execution of planned events, such as shopping holidays, product launches, and migrations."

1. Scroll down to mouse over the "$29" on the Pricing line at the bottom of the table.

   ![aws-onboarding-pricing-179x101-7688](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40592743-edf804f8-61df-11e8-82e4-d48308fe1c92.jpg)

   PROTIP: Pricing for Developer support is the Greater of $29 or 3% of monthly AWS usage,
   so you will pay more than $29 if you spend more than $966.67.

1. Scroll back up to click the "Pricing example" link on the right.
1. Notice that if your spend is $2,000, Amazon bills you $60 for support, not $29.

   <img alt="aws-onboarding-price-example-533x307-27004.jpg" width="533" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40593326-2004f3f2-61e5-11e8-956f-c74bc35a161b.jpg">

1. Click the "Business" and "Enterprise" buttons in the pop-up to see sample volume pricing tiers.

   ### Credit card

1. Provide address, which may be used to verify your credit card.

   PROTIP: CAUTION: Once you give Amazon a credit card number, you cannot remove it. Amazon can continue to charge for it until the card expires in several years.

But to limit exposure, some people provide to AWS numbers from a <a target="_blank" href="https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/cards/prepaid-cards.html">pre-paid reloadable Visa</a> gift <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/accepted-payment-methods/">(debit) card</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/find-card/get-prepaid-card">pre-paid online</a> (which has an expiration date and some have a monthly service fee). The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drawpayvisa.com/">Drawpay card</a> provides a 1% refund on purchases and a mobile app to view balances. Others provide fee-Free cash withdrawal at over 25,000 MoneyPass ATMs.

   Students may want to create several accounts to take advantage of the free tier multiple times. However, uniquely different phone numbers, addresses, and credit cards are not needed for each identity.

9. PROTIP: Where you keep information about your credit card, note the email address and account name using that credit card.

1. Confirm the phone number by answering Amazon's phone call.   

1. For now, click "Free" to select a plan. A <a href="#ComparePlans">comparison on plans is discussed below</a>.

1. Click "Free" to be prompted to sign-in with your new credentials.

   <a name="AccountId"></a>

   <strong>When signing in under IAM, type your Account Id number rather than your root email address.</strong>

   ![aws-singnin-333x362](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/78318041-0e268f00-7521-11ea-8139-3188bb81f13e.png)

   To identify your Account ID:

5. Click on your name on the upper black menu at the top of the page, then select "My Account".

1. Click your account name at the top black menu for this menu:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account"><img alt="aws-onboarding-myaccount-184x222-9824.jpg" width="184" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40592391-ecd60128-61db-11e8-941f-784a35c9d9ff.jpg"></a>

1. Copy the <strong>Account Id</strong> and paste it in the notes associated with where you saed your account email and password (within 1Password).

   PROTIP: This 12 digit number is given out for others to use to sign in using 
   <a href="#SubAccounts">sub-accounts</a>.

1. Scroll down to click "Edit" next to "Alternate Contacts" and put the other person who knows how to get into the account in for the Billing.

1. Scroll down to click Edit to the right of "Configure Security Challenge Questions".
1. Write down your security challenge questions and answers where you wrote your Account Id.

   PROTIP: Treat the answers as another set of passwords because others my discover the real answers via social engineering. Answer with some nonsense that has no basis in reality.

   https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home</a>
   
1. PROTIP: Bookmark this URL


   ### All Amazon services

1. PROTIP: The <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-services/jdkmpaoglhnpimfciphnednpkfbnphkp">Chrome browser extension "AWS Services"</a> provides a list of services by name and category so you can click it to get to Console and documentation for each service.



1. In the AWS Console, click to view all <strong>Services</strong> at the upper-left black menu band for:

   https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home

1. Scroll to the category "Security, Identify, and Compliance" list of ever-growing services:

   ![aws-iam-svcs-cat-207x318-16992](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38159747-1bb95b90-346c-11e8-940a-a0f3de709dfa.jpg)

   ### Root account lockdown

1. On a browser in the AWS Management Console, select <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">IAM</a> (for Identity Access Management) for the list <strong>Security Status</strong>

   A new account will have this:

   ![aws-iam-status-334x256-24837](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38159769-9adbb7b0-346c-11e8-8cb9-044eba2a18f0.jpg)

   To get back to this later, click "Dashboard" on the IAM menu on the left.

   The FAQ to this is at <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs</a>

10. Click on "Delete your root access key".

11. Check "Don't show me this message again" and Continue to Security Credentials.


    ### Password

12. PROTIP: Use 1Password to store your passwords so that you can use a "strong" password of so many characters that it will take hackers too much time to crack it. Because you only have to remember one master password, you can are free to change various passwords as often as you want with no fear of forgetting them.

    ### Apply an IAM password policy 

12. Click "Manage Password Policy" so AWS will ensure that "strong" passwords are used (and not easy to guess ones).

    AWS defaults are terrible:

    ![aws-iam-weak-386x336-39852](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38160240-8cbdb006-3477-11e8-914c-faea51864405.jpg)

    Over time, as hackers have access to more powerful computers that can guess passwords quicker,
    so larger passwords are necessary to make it more difficult to crack.

13. PROTIP: The <strong>largest Minimum password length AWS allows is 128 characters</strong>. But 1Password can generate up to only 64 characters. Practically, 22 characters is a reasonable minimum. Require at least one number (digits) and one non-alphanumeric symbol character.

    ![aws-iam-1password-291x259-19343](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38160291-93acae16-3478-11e8-80ac-7d5ae3bbd5c4.jpg)

14. Scroll down to "Security Token Service Regions" and deactivate regions your organization will never use.

    PROTIP: The region is where most of your users are located.
    New services are usually restricted to one region, such as N. Virginia or N. California where AWS does development work.


    ### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

    This has AWS text or call your smartphone (a virtual device) to make sure that it's really you logging in.
 
1. Click <strong>Activate MFA</strong>
1. Click "A virtual MFA device".
1. Click Next Steps.

   <a name="MFAmobile"></a>

   ### Install MFA app

1. On your iPhone or Android mobile app, open the Store app.
1. Search for <strong>Google Authenticator</strong> app (if you don't already have it installed).
1. Click "Get" to install it.

1. Click "Open".

1. In the the Google Authenticator app, click the "+" icon at the top of the screen.
1. Click "Scan barcode".
1. Align the QR code (with the square of dots) within the green box.
1. Wait for the Google Authenticator app to display two codes. Under the codes we want now 
    begins with "root-account-mfa-device@" followed by the 12-digit <a href="#AccountId">Account Id</a>.
1. Type the first code for the account into the AWS Console website "Authentication code 1".

    PROTIP: Do not type the space between numbers so that you enter only 6 digits.

1. Press Tab and type the second code in "Authentication code 2".

    PROTIP: A new code is created every minute.

1. Scroll down to click "Activate virtual MFA" at the bottom of the screen.


   ### MFA in profile

   To specify use of MFA in an assumed role provider profile, see this example of credentials file:

   <pre>
    [profile prod-access]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ReinventProdAccess
    source_profile=development
   &nbsp;
    [profile prod-full-s3-access]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/FullS3Access
    source_profile=development
    mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::18490616333:mfa/james
   </pre>

1. Test on Console: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyx23bvamI">VIDEO</a>:

    <pre><strong>aws s3 ls --profile prod-full-s3-access</strong></pre>

    The response is a prompt waiting for manual input:

    <pre>Enter MFA code: _</pre>



    ### Create Admin sub-account

1. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home">IAM page</a>
   click "Create individual IAM users". What it says is important:

   "Create IAM users and give them only the permissions they need. Do not use your AWS root account for day-to-day interaction with AWS, because the root account provides unrestricted access to your AWS resources."

2. Click "Manage users".
3. Click "Add User".
4. PROTIP: For the user name field, define a pattern of up to <strong>64 characters</strong>
   with <strong>dashes</strong> (instead of spaces and underlines) to separate words.

   For the Administrator to do work (of assigning): 

   <tt><strong>root-admin-work</strong></tt>

5. Click "Programmatic access".
6. If you would like to use AWS Management Console access, leave the default for
   Autogenerated password because you'll create a new password at next sign-in.
7. Click "Next: Permissions".

   We'll <a href="#Groups">add groups later, below</a>.

8. Click "Attach existing policies directly" because the Admin account it is limited.

9. Rather than granting "<strong>AdministratorAccess</strong>" which gives all access, 
   give policy to what :

   * SystemAdministrator
   * IAMFullAccess covers the others:

      * IAMReadOnlyAccess
      * IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCriteria
      * IAMUserChangePassword
      * IAMUserSSHKeys
   
10. Click "Next: Review".
11. Click "Create user".


    ### Inform user of credentials

12. To see what is sent if you click "Send email", right-click on the link and "Copy Link", then paste in a text editor to see:

    <pre>subject=Welcome to Amazon Web Services
    body=Hello,  You have been given access to the AWS Management Console for the Amazon Web Services account ID ending in 8630. You can get started by using the sign-in information provided below.%0A%0ASign-in URL: https://103265058630.signin.aws.amazon.com/console%0AUser name: root-admin-work   
    Your initial sign-in password will be provided separately from this email. When you sign in for the first time, you must change your password. 
    Sincerely, Your AWS Account Administrator</pre>

13. PROTIP: Along with the Access Key Id and Secret access key, the default Region and format are also required to perform "aws configure", so add that information in the email.

    PROTIP: Add what AWS Groups and associated Policies the user has been given.

    PROTIP: Also include in the email, for those who
    use AWS CLI, how to install it and 3rd-party tools.
    
    For those who use the AWS Console GUI, explain the mobile apps to install.
    Provide them the URL with the region included, such as:

    <a target="_blank" href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2">https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2</a>

    NOTE: Baking different zones into Console URLs makes for more direct connections and removes issues from using a single URL/DNS.

14. Click "Download .csv" to download a "credentials.csv" file to your Downloads folder.
    It contains columns are a couple columns different than the "Add User" GUI:

    <tt>User name, Password, Access key ID, Secret access key, Console login link</tt>

    The "Console login link" is the "Sign-in URL" in the email.


    ### Apply an IAM password policy 

12. Click "Manage Password Policy" so AWS will ensure that "strong" passwords are used (and not easy to guess ones).

   AWS defaults are terrible:
   <img alt="aws-iam-weak-386x336-39852" width="386" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38160240-8cbdb006-3477-11e8-914c-faea51864405.jpg"></a>

   PROTIP: Over time, as hackers have access to more powerful computers that can guess passwords quicker, larger passwords are necessary to make them more difficult to crack.

13. PROTIP: The largest Minimum password length AWS allows is 128 characters. 1Password can generate up to only 64 characters. Practically, 22 characters is a reasonable minimum. Require at least one number and one non-alphanumeric character.

    ![aws-iam-1password-291x259-19343](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/38160291-93acae16-3478-11e8-80ac-7d5ae3bbd5c4.jpg)

    PROTIP: Each site may have different rules about what special characters are allowed.
    So generate a smaller string, then manually add special characters. Copy the final string before pasting into the form.

14. Click "Apply password policy".


    ### Deactivate regions not used

    On the same "Account settings" page:

14. Scroll down to "Security Token Service Regions" and deactivate regions your organization are not using.

    PROTIP: Select a Region where most of your target users are located.
    New services are usually restricted to one region, such as N. Virginia or N. California where AWS does development work.


    <a name="SignInAdmin"></a>

    ### Admin Sign In

1. Sign out and sign in again to the AWS Console using the newly created admin sub-account.


   ### Quick Access icons

   Save time by quickly get to the most frequently used services by having their icons at the top (black) menu bar.

1. Click the push-pin icon.
1. One by one, drag the icon on the list and drop it on the top black menu to the left of the orange push pin. If you don't see the black menu, pause just under the browser URL for the browser to automatically scroll.

   PROTIP: The services most often used are IAM, VPC, EC2, S3

1. If you have good memory of what icons mean, change the Settings to "Icons only".

   <img alt="aws-onboarding-icons-only-277x112-9365.jpg" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/40741420-c21d19b0-6408-11e8-9c8d-84c5afd9a8bd.jpg">

## Mobile apps for smart phones

1. Get the <strong>AWS Console</strong> app on your mobile phone:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/AWS-Mobile-LLC-Console/dp/B00ATSN730">On Google Android mobile phones</a>

   On your iPhone, open the Store app and search to get <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aws-console/id580990573?mt=8">AWS Console</a>. Make sure the publisher is <strong>AMZN Mobile LLC</strong>  which creates <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/amzn-mobile-llc/id297606954?mt=8">all Amazon's apps</a>.

   PROTIP: These apps got low review scores because the app only lets people read-only,
   but not change anything. And the 2FA is clunky.

2. <strong>Add an identity</strong>: select Root/IAM account or Federation.
3. Enable Face ID on iPhones.
4. Provide email, CAPTCHA security, password, email verification code. Success is seeing this:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1694653422/aws-mobile-iOS-1170x2532_ns4mgt.png"><img alt="aws-mobile-iOS-1170x2532.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1694653422/aws-mobile-iOS-1170x2532_ns4mgt.png"></a>

## HashiCorp Terraform

HashiCorp's Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvNqfgojocs&t=8m25s">VIDEO</a>: To use <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/terraform">Terrafrom</a> IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to create a AWS EC2 instances (<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c">instead of Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc.):

   CAUTION: The AWS way of keeping credentials in the <tt>$HOME/.aws/credentials</tt> file is not secure because if your laptop is compromised or stolen, those secrets could be used without authentication. So many organizations request that secret credential files be temporary (valid for just one day). So some make available a corporate "Vending Machine" app which generates credentials instead of the manual process below.

1. Click on your email at the upper-right corner to select "Security credentials" for the IAM page.
1. Scroll to click "Create Access keys", "Command Line Interface".
1. Check "I understand", "Next".
1. Construct a Description tag value  that satisfies your organization's naming conventions.
1. Click "Create access key".

1. Switch to a Terminal to issue <tt>aws configure</tt> to specify the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

   PROTIP: The <tt>aws configure</tt> command creates a file at <tt>$HOME/.aws/credentials</tt> with the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

1. Switch back to the web page.
1. Click the copy icon for the Access Key. Switch to your secret file and paste the value into a text file.
1. Click the copy icon for the Secret Access key. Switch to your secret file and paste it into the same text file.
1. Specify Default region such as <tt>us-east-1</tt> - the default.
1. Specify Default output format <tt>json</tt>.

1. Switch to the web page to click "Done".
1. Identify a GitHub repo you want.

1. Switch to the Terminal.
1. Create or navigate to a folder for your GitHub account to receive repositories cloned.
1. Get that sample Terraform repo, and cd into it.

   <pre><strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/aws-ec2-micro.git --depth 1
   cd aws-ec2-micro
   </strong></pre>
   
   PROTIP: Typically, for secure production usage, many resources would be created, including roles to limit access. So using Terraform would be faster, easier, more accurate, and more secure than manual creation clicking and typing on the AWS Console GUI.

1. Edit the files which specify the AWS provider described at <a target="_blank" href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs">https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs</a>, such as this <tt>main.tf</tt> 

   <pre>
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"
   }
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   </pre>

   REMEMBER: The ami id is tied to the region and instance_type <a targete="_blank" href="https://www.appsloveworld.com/amazon-ec2/4/get-latest-ami-id-for-aws-instance">for which it was created</a>. For that reason, many run a Bash script to <a target="_blank" href="https://letslearndevops.com/2018/08/23/terraform-get-latest-centos-ami/">get the latest ami</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/packer">use the Packer utility</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/2756">create a custom ami</a>. That is safer than referencing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/EC2/approved-golden-amis.html">"golden" ami images</a> created by another organization to meet compliance standards: APRA, MAS, and NIST4.

   PROTIP: We recommend that you run a Bash shell file to select the latest ami and for whatever region was selected for the server instance_type. The script can confirm whether the instance_type specified is available in the region specified. The script would also have coding to set environment variables in a secure way, consistently over time among teammates. This also enables AWS Tags to be specified effortlessly, such as "CreatedBy" with your email address pulled in automatically. See my documentation.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://serverfault.com/questions/369872/run-a-bash-script-after-ec2-instance-boots">PROTIP</a>: Many specify in the <tt>user_data</tt> section within the <tt>main.tf</tt> file Bash scripts containing Ansible commands to run immediately after EC2 instance boot up.

1. A <tt>terraform.tfvars</tt> file is commonly specified to specify custom values to replace default values in the <tt>main.tf</tt> file.

   PROTIP: The <tt>terraform.tfvars</tt> file may contain secrets, so its file name is specified in <tt>.gitignore</tt> to prevent it from being checked into GitHub.

1. The script would <a target="_blank" href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-provisioners">collect locally Terraform provider files</a> specified in the <tt>main.tf</tt> file:

   <pre><strong>terraform init
   </strong></pre>

1. Create resources:

   <pre><strong>terraform plan --auto-approve --var-file=../vars/ec2.tfvars
   </strong></pre>

   If that works:

   <pre><strong>terraform apply --auto-approve --var-file=../vars/ec2.tfvars
   </strong></pre>

   The <tt>--auto-approve</tt> option is used to avoid the need to type "yes" to confirm.

   PROTIP: A Bash script issuing the above commands would add additional steps such as checking for errors, to ensure that resources with vulnerabilities are not even created.

1. Switch back to the web page to view the resources.

1. Use the resources.

1. Delete the resources previously created by Terraform files in the folder:

   <pre><strong>terraform destroy --var-file=../vars/ec2.tfvars
   </strong></pre>

1. REMEMBER: Delete the credentials file after use.

<a name="ProgrammaticAccess"></a>

## Programmatic Access

Instead of doing what other clouds do (an <tt>aws login</tt> command which prompt for a user name and password), aws commands reference a specifically-named file at <tt>$HOME/.aws/credentials</tt> created by command <tt>aws configure</tt>.

The <tt>aws configure</tt> command creates that file after prompting for access key identifiers (AKIDs) to an AWS account. Press Enter to accept the value previously defined:

   * AWS Access Key ID [****************L5ZQ]:
   * AWS Secret Access Key [****************+1MD]:
   <br /><br />

Stored with credentials are also:

   * Default region name [us-east-1]: 
   * Default output format [json]:
   <br /><br />

To create AKID credentials, AWS asks that account owners to manually use the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM GUI</a> to disable programmatic access to their <strong>root</strong> (email) account and protect it with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">MFA (Multi-factor Authentication)</a>

The AWS Management Console provides a way for account owners (administrators) to manually create <strong>IAM user accounts</strong> for programmatic access.

For programmatic access to resources running inside AWS, the best practice is to use IAM roles which are not associated with a specific user or group. Any trusted entity can <strong>assume the role</strong> to perform a specific business task. A resource can be granted access without hardcoding an access key ID and secret access key into the configuration file. For example, you can grant an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket by attaching a role with a policy that defines this access to the EC2 instance. IAM dynamically manages the credentials for you with temporary credentials it rotates automatically.

Outside AWS (on a Terminal/Console on your laptop), a dedicated service account should be created for each use case with only the permissions needed to limit the "blast radius" if credentials are compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.



CAUTION: The problem with IAM user account secrets is that they are <strong>long-running secrets</strong> stored in the credentials file in <strong>clear-text</strong>. Someone who clicks on a roque link on a phishing email would expose that file for theft. Many who lose control of their AWS credentials see bills from Amazon of thousands of dollars in unauthorized use (mining Bitcoins).

CloudAcademy.com and many enterprises create a centrally-administered
https://aws.amazon.com/code/token-vending-machine-for-identity-registration-sample-java-web-application/
"Vending Machine" application to generate and dispense <strong>temporary</strong> IAM user accounts with access keys. Such credentials are valid for only 12 hours or less. 

But that requires tedious repeated manual effort.
Securing temporary accounts with MFA adds to that toil.

<a name="S3BucketNames"></a>

### Claim S3 Bucket names

   The AWS Account Administrator has a fudiciary responsibility to secure 
   Intellectual Property assets.

   S3 Bucket names are universally unique among all AWS customers.
   So just as there are domain name squatters who register and sit on .com host names
   for sale at high prices to those who actually use the names,
   the administrator of root accounts for an organization should
   register your organization's brand names before others get them first.

   To create a bucket for each host name registered on GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.

4. Click S3 from among services.
5. Click the blue "Create bucket" button.
6. Type in the host name (such as "wilsonmar.com") in the Bucket name field.
7. Select your home Region.

   PROTIP: Claiming a Bucket name in one region locks it up for all Regions.

8. Click "Next".
9. Click "Next".
10. Click "Next" to manage users.
11. Click "Create Bucket".

## Automatic key rotation

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html
describes automatic rotatation of AKID credentials (with a quick MFA challenge answered on a mobile phone)

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/131071038-7becbc2a-3f87-4c07-8247-21b42fb21d85.png"><img alt="aws-AccessKeyAutoRotate-799x830" width="799" height="830" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/131071038-7becbc2a-3f87-4c07-8247-21b42fb21d85.png"></a>

The auto-rotation of AWS IAM User Access Keys diagrammed above is from <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/automatically-rotate-iam-user-access-keys.html">these guideline from Feb. 2019</a> uses MIT-licensed CloudFormation templates and Python scripts defined in https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iam-access-key-auto-rotation and described <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iam-access-key-auto-rotation/blob/main/AWS%20Security%20Audit%20Findings%20Remediation%20Runbook.docx">step-by-step in this Word-format Document</a>.

Setup S3 buckets in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1). It runs every 90 days. At 100 days it disables and at 110 days it deletes the old Access Keys. It sets up a secret inside AWS Secrets Manager to store the new Access Keys, with a resource policy that permits only the AWS IAM User access to them. 

Another automation sets up an Amazon DynamoDB table to house the email addresses of accounts rotated.
These emails are used by a SNS Topic to send alerts when rotation occurs.

Alternately, you can refactor to send a Slack message instead of email (not shown in the diagram).

Additionally, add conditions to the policy that further restrict access, such as the source IP address range of clients. The example policy below grants the needed permissions (PutObject) on to a specific resource (an S3 bucket named “examplebucket”) while adding further conditions (the client must come from IP range 203.0.113.0/24):

<a name="IAM-CLI"></a>

### IAM CLI #

   AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls access to
   users, groups, roles, and policies.

6. List users:

   <pre><strong>
   aws iam list-users --query Users[*].UserName
   </strong></pre>

8. List groups which the user belongs to :

   <tt><strong>
   aws iam list-groups-for-user \-\-username ???
   </strong></tt>

9. Create a new user named "MyUser":

   <pre>
   aws iam create-user --user-name MyUser
   </pre>

   The response is:

   <pre>
{
    "User": {
        "UserName": "MyUser",
        "Path": "/",
        "CreateDate": "2012-12-20T03:13:02.581Z",
        "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser"
    }
}</pre>

1. Add the user to the group:

   <pre>aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name MyUser --group-name MyIamGroup</pre>

1. To verify that the MyIamGroup group contains the MyUser, use the get-group command:

    <pre>aws iam get-group --group-name MyIamGroup</pre>

    The response:

    <pre>
    {
        "Group": {
            "GroupName": "MyIamGroup",
            "CreateDate": "2012-12-20T03:03:52Z",
            "GroupId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/MyIamGroup",
            "Path": "/"
        },
        "Users": [
            {
                "UserName": "MyUser",
                "Path": "/",
                "CreateDate": "2012-12-20T03:13:02Z",
                "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser"
            }
        ],
        "IsTruncated": "false"
    }</pre>

<a name="ForumAccount"></a>

## [_] Create Forum Account

1. PROTIP: To ensure anonymity interacting on public forums, the Administrator should create in a public email system (such as gmail.com, hotmail.com, etc.) an email address for use on forums. Don't use a real name in the email address, but a positive adjective with a number to ensure it's unique, such as "concerned123".

   AWS says "Your email will be kept private" but I don't trust that they can't be hacked.

2. Go to the AWS forums at URL:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=150">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=150</a>

3. Register the new email address along with an AWS Nickname without a proper name, such as, again, "concerned123".

3. Use that email in StackOverflow.com and other public forums.

2. To verify the identity being used in AWS CLI:

   <pre><strong>aws sts get-caller-identity</strong></pre>

   A sample response:

   <pre>
    "Account": "103265058630", 
    "UserId": "AIDAJHXCZNAH2MEXAMPLE",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::103265058630:user/root-admin-work"
   </pre>

   Alternately, use an <a href="#Aliases">alias defined</a>:

   <pre>aws whoami</pre>


   <a name="Groups"></a>

   ### Define groups to assign permissions 

   PROTIP: For a user to do something usually require several AWS resources.
   So several permissions need to be granted to a user.
   To simplify assignments, we define Groups of permissions which we then can assign to each user.

   In other words, An IAM group is a management convenience to manage the same set of permissions for a set of IAM users.

   The AWS CLI command to create a group named "MyIamGroup" is:

   <pre>aws iam create-group --group-name MyIamGroup
   </pre>

   A sample response:

   <pre>{
    "Group": {
        "GroupName": "MyIamGroup",
        "CreateDate": "2012-12-20T03:03:52.834Z",
        "GroupId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/MyIamGroup",
        "Path": "/"
    }
}
   </pre>

   The AWS CLI command to create a S3 security group:

   <pre><strong>aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-sg --description "My security group"
   </strong></pre>

   A sample response:

   <pre>{
   "GroupId": "sg-903004f8"
   }</pre>

27. Click Manage Groups then Create New Group.
  
    PROTIP: Groups are usually associated with a particular job: admin, sales, HR, front-end developer, back-end developer, etc. 
    
    A user can belong to multiple groups.
    More complex organizations manage differences in permissions for company, division, project, location, job level, etc. So 128 characters may not be enough if large words are used. Thus, abbreviate and use acronyms.

    PROTIP: Put abbreviations and acronyms in a wiki publicly available to avoid duplicate usage.

28. "aws_iot_buttons" is the group name I use as an example.

   PROTIP: Use dashes. Space characters are not allowed.
   On March 1, 2018 AWS removed the ability to use underscores in S3 bucket names.

   The list shown are "AWS Managed".

29. Click on Policy Type to select Job function.

30. PROTIP: Instead of scrolling down the massive list in <strong>Attache Policy</strong> (Alexa, Amazon, AWS, etc.),
    type in the Filter field the first few letters (such as "IoT") and the list gets smaller. Notice the filter you type is applicable to not just characters beginning with what you typed, but also characters inside names as well.

31. Click to select.
32. Click "Create Group".

    Note different policies have different levels of access, with admin having more capabilities than "read only" ones.

33. Names shown on the screen is called a "Policy Summary".
34. Click "JSON" to see the file that AWS reads to assign policies. Here you seen what <strong>Actions</strong> the policy allows.

35. Click "Access Advisor" to see users who have been assigned to use the policy.

    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-iot-policy.html


<hr />

## Manually Rotate Access keys

    See that "AWS recommends that you rotate your access keys every 90 days"?
    Some find it easier to remember by doing it on the first day of each month.
    Why? There are thousands of big computers around the world literally staying up at night trying different combinations.
   
24. PROTIP: Make an appointment on your Calendar with a recurring schedule.

    PROTIP: Rotation applies to access key of IAM child accounts, not the root account.

    You don't want programmatic access to your root account, so you don't need no stinkin' keys.

25. Click Delete to the key. Write down the date Created.

    Don't create a new Access Key.


    ### Use groups to assign permissions 

    PROTIP: For a user to do something usually require several AWS resources.
    So several permissions need to be granted to a user.
    To simplify assignments, we define Groups of permissions which we then can assign to each user.

    In other words, An IAM group is a management convenience to manage the same set of permissions for a set of IAM users.

27. Click Manage Groups then Create New Group.
  
    PROTIP: Groups are usually associated with a particular job: admin, sales, HR, front-end developer, back-end developer, etc. 
    
    A user can belong to multiple groups.
    More complex organizations manage differences in permissions for company, division, project, location, job level, etc. So 128 characters may not be enough if large words are used. Thus, abbreviate and use acronyms.

    PROTIP: Put abbreviations and acronyms in a wiki publicly available to avoid duplicate usage.

28. "aws_iot_buttons" is the group name I use as an example.

   PROTIP: Use underlines or dashes. Space characters are not allowed.

   The list shown are "AWS Managed".

29. Click on Policy Type to select Job function.

30. PROTIP: Instead of scrolling down the massive list in <strong>Attache Policy</strong> (Alexa, Amazon, AWS, etc.),
    type in the Filter field the first few letters (such as "IoT") and the list gets smaller. Notice the filter you type is applicable to not just characters beginning with what you typed, but also characters inside names as well.

31. Click to select.
32. Click "Create Group".

    Note different policies have different levels of access, with admin having more capabilities than "read only" ones.

33. Names shown on the screen is called a "Policy Summary".
34. Click "JSON" to see the file that AWS reads to assign policies. Here you seen what <strong>Actions</strong> the policy allows.

35. Click "Access Advisor" to see users who have been assigned to use the policy.

    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-iot-policy.html



    ### Create IAM Users

36. Click Users on the left menu.
36. Click Add User.
36. Specify User Name. For example: user1@myco.com

    PROTIP: Use underscores to separate words in IAM User Names rather than spaces.

36. Check "Programmatic Access".
36. Uncheck "User must create a new password at next sign-in".
36. Click "Next: Permissions".
36. Click "Attach existing policies directly" for the first user.

    PROTIP: The policy attached depends on what the user will be allowed to do.

37. Send to each user the AccountId, UserName using a different mode of communication than the  password.
37. User signs in using the credentials Account Id, the UserName, and password
37. Click "Send email"

    PROTIP: Send credentials to your <strong>alternate email</strong> rather than to a cloud drive (Amazon, Google, Box, etc.); an email account that you setup with a fake birthdate and other personal information; one you never give out to anyone.

## Roles for federated access

An analogy is a private ball where royal guests arrive wearing formal attire present an invitation card to enter.
The fancy outfits with sashes and medals are kinda like group permissions that confer permissions to someone.
The invitation card is kinda like IAM roles which are only for specific times.

The host of the party is kinda like AWS's STS (Security Token Service) identify broker
which grants access tokens to enable services to "assume" a role to perform on AWS services.

IAM roles are used by computer programs reaching through Enterprise identity federation into Microsoft Active Directory
using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) or through Web identity federation into Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.

IAM roles issue keys are valid for short durations, making them a more secure way to grant access.

An IAM user needs to be granted two distinct permissions to launch EC2 instances with roles:

   * Permission to launch EC2 instances.
   * Permission to associate an IAM role with EC2 instances.
   <br /><br />

STS returns:

   * A Security Token
   * An Access Key ID
   * A Secret Access Key

### More security

* egress rules on your Security Groups (after all there's no reason ever that your database should be connecting to IP addresses in Russia), 
* vulnerability scanning, 
* Host-Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS) systems

<a name="SecureCredential"></a>

## Encrypt AWS Credentials

Use my shell script to log into AWS by decrypting credentials stored securely (instead of in plain text). 

One reason to encrypt credentials is because it's wise to have a backup copy of the secret file, in an encrypted format, somewhere else. This enables you to retrieve secrets in case you lose your laptop.

This article covers use of AWS (Amazon Web Services) on MacOS. In the future I'll be updating this article to cover use of Windows and other secret-handling utilities (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, HashiCorp Vault, Akeyless, etc.).

After obtaining an AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key for your account (described above),
use the credentials on your local machine (laptop), install the AWS CLI locally. Although there is a "awscli" Homebrew formula, but it has been deprecated. So follow this doc to manually install a pkg file for awscli2:

## Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS

AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same aws command name. 

If you have both versions installed, your computer uses the…docs.aws.amazon.com

The installer automatically creates a symlink in a folder in your PATH which links to the main program in the installation folder you chose:

   <pre><strong>ls -al $(which aws)</strong></pre>

   If you see a response such as this:

   <pre>-rwxr-xr-x  1 wilsonmar  staff  830 Jul 21 09:07 /usr/local/anaconda3/bin/aws</pre>

1. Verify install:

   <pre><strong>aws --version</strong></pre>

   A sample response (at time of writing):

   <pre>aws-cli/1.20.3 Python/3.7.3 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/1.21.3</pre>

   QUESTION: Why does the pkg say "1.20.3"?

1. Amazon documentation says to run:

   <tt>aws configure</tt>

   That command prompts acceptance or override of default AWS ACCESS KEY ID, AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY, and region saved as a plain-text file at 

   <pre>~/.aws/credentials</pre>

   Sample contents:

   <pre>[default]
aws_access_key_id = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
aws_secret_access_key = 123456786iJsvzQbkIlDiFtBh6DrPzIw8r7hVb35
[py-ec2–1]
aws_access_key_id = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
aws_secret_access_key = 123456782Nwk156aPF0SxZ8KGY+RrhEbq3AIHUSS
   </pre>

   BTW Progress toward AWS providing a more secure approach is at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk/issues/41

   Meanwhile, to avoid having credentials in clear text, store them in encrypted form:

1. Install GPG locally using my instructions at 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-signing">https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-signing</a>

1. Generate encrypted file "credentials.gpg" from file "credentials". See:

   https://wilsonmar.github.io/git-signing/#bonus-encrypting-whole-files-using-gpg

1. To be able to retrieve secrets in case you lose your laptop, for backup make a copy of the secret file in encrypted format, somewhere else.

1. Make a backup of GPG keys somewhere else (in a key vault) so you can decrypt. One way is to store your private key in a Yubikey USB chip you plug into your laptop.

1. Using the GPG private key, encrypt the aws/credentials file to a new credentials.gpg file also in the same ~/.aws folder.

1. Delete the file at ~/.aws/credentials

1. Download my shell script:

   <pre>curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/main/bash/awslogin.sh" -o "awslogin.sh"</pre>

   NOTE: It works similar to https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault, but with no external dependencies (other than GPG). However, aws-vault supports several vaulting backends.

1. Run the script to login based on the encrypted credential.gpg file:

   <pre>source ~/awslogin.sh</pre>

   Alternately, run the script to use the "susan" profile defined:

   <pre>source ~/awslogin.sh -p susan</pre>

   The script unencrypts the gpg file, invokes aws login, then removes the unencrypted file.
   
   BONUS: To parse variables from within an AWS credentials file, consider:
   GitHub - whereisaaron/get-aws-profile-bash: Fetch AWS keys and secrets from ~/.aws/credentials…

   This is a pure bash script that can parse and extract AWS credentials (key id and secret) from a ~/.aws/credentials…github.com

   If you use it, remember to clear out variables after usage, so they don't linger in memory.
