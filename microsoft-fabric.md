This is a hands-on technical tutorial that takes you logically step-by-step to quickly learn how to setup, navigate, and use the <strong>Microsoft Fabric</strong> cloud and pass <a href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/azure-certifications/">Azure certification exam</a>

   * <a href="#DP-600">DP-600: Fabric Analytic Engineer Associate</a>
   <br /><br />

{% include whatever.html %}

BTW, don't confuse Microsoft Fabric with "Azure Service Fabric" (a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers.)

Let's dive right into the Microsoft Fabric working portal GUI:

<a name="Diagram"></a>

## Architecture Diagram

PROTIP: I adapted <a target="_blank" href="https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/fkrvnn" title="Available for purchase">the diagram below</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4i5lcROJcs">VIDEO</a>: The best 38-minute summary by <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/">Will Needham</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview">Microsoft</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://adatis.co.uk/microsoft-fabric-announcement-accelerate-your-data-potential/">others</a> to show, all in one page, relationships among key technology components in Microsoft Fabric:
<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708487536/ms-fabric-arch-240219-1920x1080_cupx3o.png"><img alt="ms-fabric-arch-240219-1920x1080.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708487536/ms-fabric-arch-240219-1920x1080_cupx3o.png"><br /><em>Click for full-size image</em></a>.

Starting from the bottom:
Microsoft Fabric competes with <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/snowflake/">Snowflake and <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/databricks/">Databricks</a>, who pioneered the use of "Medallion" data processing into Parquet-formatted files which enables "schema on read" such that data can be streamed into the same database.

1. Within <strong>OneLake</strong>, data is not transferred when it's transformed (from OLTP to OLAP).
It even supports "time travel" like in GitHub source can revert entire sets of files to commit points in the past.

1. Fabric consists of four different <strong>compute engines</strong> to support the different technologies for different uses:

   * A Traditional T-SQL engine to process T-SQL queries that insert data into data warehouses.
   * A Spark "Big Data" engine to process PySpark jobs and Python Notebooks into Data Lakehouses.
   * Python Notebooks also generate ML (Machine Learning) models from files in OneLake

   * Eventstreams add Telemetry in TSDB (Time Series Databases) which KQL (Kusto Query Language) querysets query
   * A PBI Analytic engine to process <a href="#dax-studio">DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)</a> for calculating KPI (Key Process Indicators) on reports and dashboards.
   * <a href="#Reflex">Reflex</a> rules set by Data Citizens and Data Analysts using the no-code GUI Data Activator, which also fires triggers when it identifies events relevant to Reflex specs in OneLake files.
   <br /><br />

1. <strong>Shortcuts</strong> pointing to specific sets of data -- good for Data Archivists to obtain to take backups.

   Shortcuts are also used for Security Guards to tag data for Microsoft Purview to automatically assign permissions on data in OneLake, S3, and other file types.

1. Microsoft names GUI "Experiences" based on the role of the primary role using them:

   1. Data Analysts use Data Factory to run Dataflows that create and load data into OneLake files.
   1. Data Engineers establish Data Warehouses using "Synapse Data Warehouse",
   1. establish Lakehouses using "Synapse Data Engineering", and
   1. establish Telemetry databases using "Synapse Real-Time Analytics.
   1. Data Analysts reference established data stores to create reports and dashboards using Power BI
   1. Data Scientists work with Synapse Data Science to create or tune ML Models by running experiments from data in OneLake.
   1. Data Citizens use the no-code Data Activator to define Reflex rules that trigger actions based on various events.
   <br /><br />

1. PROTIP: For Fabric to access data in Microsoft's CosmosDB multi-region multi-format database, there is a Sync product that <strong>mirrors</strong> the databases. Yes, this doubles the cost, like welding a new car to your old car.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1709766939/ms-fabric-history-3150x1768_roevf7.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1709766939/ms-fabric-history-3150x1768_roevf7.png"></a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZnv3RhTJQ&t=32m30s">VIDEO</a>:
The diagram above <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregbeaumont/">Greg Beaumont</a>
traces the brand names and technologies that culminated in Microsoft Fabric.

As with Databricks and Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric provides a "Medallion" architecture to go from OLTP to OLAP:
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZnv3RhTJQ">VIDEO</a>:
<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1709913285/wzdrqv0ox5vp9n14e46d.png"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1709913285/wzdrqv0ox5vp9n14e46d.png"></a>

Raw historical data in CSV files -- Bronze -- are loaded into a (Python) Spark Notebook within OneLake files to become Silver curated data accessible by a Fabric Data Warehouse view, which a Fabric Pipeline loads into a star-schema Gold (Optimized).
The Metadata is used by PowerBI to create reports and dashboards.

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/roles-workspaces">Built-in Roles for Microsoft Fabric Workspace</a> specify that:

   * Admin is the only role that can "Update and delete the workspace" and "Add or remove people, including other admins",  plus all other capabilities".
   * Admin & Member are the only roles that can "Add members or others with lower permissions" and "Allow others to reshare items".
   * QUESTION:
Who can <strong>delete</strong>?

## Browser Profile

1. PROTIP: In an internet browser (Safari, Google Chrome, etc.) I click the icon next to the browser's three-dot menu to use a <strong>browser profile</strong> that retains the browser history for the <strong>work (organizational) account</strong> I need to use with Fabric.

   <a name="AdminMenu"></a>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701041117/fabric-signin-318x367_lf2lqp.png"><img alt="fabric-signin-318x367.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701041117/fabric-signin-318x367_lf2lqp.png"></a>

   <a name="HomePage"></a>

   ## Working Home Page

1. REMEMBER: The Microsoft <strong>Fabric working home page</strong> has Microsoft.com and NOT Azure, at:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://app.fabric.microsoft.com"><strong>https://app.fabric.microsoft.com</strong></a>

   This is because Microsoft intends Fabric to be a service that can exchange data with competing clouds such as AWS and GCP as well as on-prem. data centers (through Microsoft's Arc). It's a "friendamy" strategy. Fabric is how Microsoft catches up to what <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/snowflake/">Snowflake</a> and Databricks have been offering.

1. You'll see what I call the "bouncer" page ensures that only <strong>organizational</strong> emails (work or school account) use Fabric. Your personal gmail or outlook.com account is no good here. Wow.

   "You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead."

   This is why you setup a <a href="#Browser+Profile">browser profiles</a> for each email account. Click the profile icon at the top right of the browser window to switch between profiles.

   If you have a license, you'll see the fabric-landing-711x400.jpeg landing page, which lists the Fabric components you have access to.

1. Click the big round gray icon at the upper side of the Fabric page for the <a href="#AdminMenu">Admin/Sign In menu above</a>.


   ## Start Trial

1. Click the green <strong>Start trial</strong> box.

   REMEMBER: Notice the word "capacity" instead of "instances" because Fabric is a <strong>serverless</strong> service.

1. Click "Start trial".

   PROTIP: In your Calendar, add a reminder to cancel the trial before the 30 days are up.

   The trial is for the <strong>Pro</strong> tier, which is the middle tier. The <strong>Premium</strong> tier is the top tier.

   We'll come back to the "Learn more" link at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2227617  which expands to

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial

1. Select your Country (for data sovereignty) and Phone number (for SMS text verification).
1. Click <strong>Start my new trial</strong>. This creates a new <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory#what-is-an-azure-ad-tenant">Entra ID</a> (Azure Active Directory) <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant">tenant</a> tied to a DNS domain name to provide identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to applications and resources.

   1 TB is allocated to OneLake storage.

   64 capacity units (CUs) allow consumption of 64x60 CU seconds every minute when "experiences" are run.

   Each data <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-elastic-data-map">Purview Data Map</a> capacity unit includes a throughput of 25 operations/sec and 10 GB of metadata storage limit for <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-scans-and-ingestion">scanning</a>.

   PROTIP: When the capacity consumption exceeds its size, Microsoft slows down the experience similar to slowing down CPU performance.

1. Click the <strong>Admin</strong> icon at the top right of the page to see the number of days remaining in the trial.


   ### Learn More

1. PROTIP: Instead of clicking this <strong>Learn more</strong> link for the "Get started" tutorial, copy the URL and switch to your personal browser profile so you get points for learning,

   This article contains information from the following sources:

## Product Component "Experiences"

PROTIP: Although Fabric is marketed as a "unified" product, practically it's operated as a collection of products that Microsoft users navigate around.

1. Click the Microsoft Fabric icon at the bottom-left of the screen for a list of product components (without the vague marketing generalizations):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701046058/fabric-menu-624x584_de9vj1.png"><img alt="fabric-menu-624x584.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701046058/fabric-menu-624x584_de9vj1.png"></a>

   Notice that there is a group of <strong>Synapse brand</strong> data products with blue icons.
   Synapse is on Azure as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shw8FbDi4lQ&t=5m39s" title="by Deepika Bhatt with James Leonard">DEMO</a>:
   Fabric integrates into a single unified SaaS analytics platform :
   * <a href="#Data+Factory">Azure Data Factory</a>
   * Azure Data Explorer
   * Azure Synapse Analytics operates on <a href="#Workspaces">workspaces</a> containing both relational SQL databases and big-data Lake databases, all linked to blobs (files) within Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2
   * Azure Databricks
   * Azure Synapse SQL
   * Power BI to
   <br /><br />

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shw8FbDi4lQ&t=2m40s" title="by James Leonard">VIDEO</a>:
   "Synapse Data Analytics" integrates relational data with big data, both using Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2, <a href="#Data+Factory">Azure Data Factory</a>, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse SQL, and Power BI into a single unified analytics platform.

   Fabric covers the "complete spectrum" of data services including data movement, data lake, data engineering, data integration and data science, observational analytics, and business intelligence.

   But what happened to products previously shown in menus:
   * Azure Databricks - "Fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics platform"
   * Azure Data Explorer - "Fast and highly scalable data exploration service"
   * Azure Synapse Analytics - "Limitless analytics service with unmatched time to insight"
   * Azure Analysis Services - "Enterprise-grade analytics engine as a service"
   * Azure Machine Learning - "Build, train, and deploy models from the cloud to the edge"
   * Azure Stream Analytics - "Real-time analytics on fast-moving streaming data"
   * HDInsight - "Provision cloud Hadoop, Spark, R Server, HBase, and Storm clusters"
   * Microsoft Purview - "Govern, protect, and manage your data estate"
   <br /><br />

   And Copilot? It's a feature within Power BI. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqVa1Gdn4s">Tak Tech Analytics</a> explains it.

   ### Left Menus

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701174778/fabric-left-menu-66x493_x7hpur.png"><img align="right" alt="fabric-left-menu-66x493.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701174778/fabric-left-menu-66x493_x7hpur.png"></a>Click on any of the icons to see the left menu for that component:

   ### Admin verify domain

1. Click the 9-dot icon at the top left of the screen present automation options: Power Automate, Power Pages, and 365 apps at

   https://www.microsoft365.com/?auth=2&home=1

1. Click the <strong>Admin</strong> link to designate the admin for the organizational domain name used to sign in.
1. Click Next.
1. Read the "See step-by-step instructions to add DNS records" about signing into the Domain Registry (such as GoDaddy) to specify a TXT record Fabric needs to use like a password to trust the domain.
1. Return to Fabric and click <strong>Confirm record</strong> for "You're now the admin".
1. Click "Go to the admin center".
1. Finish.

   ### Left menu common items

1. Click on Power BI on the left menu:

   * <strong>Home</strong> is the landing page for the component.
   * Create
   * Browse
   * OneLake data hub
   * Monitoring hub - a station to view and track active activities across different products
   * <a href="#Workspaces">Workspaces</a>
   * My workspace
   <br /><br />

1. Click the <strong>Power BI</strong> icon (at the top as it's frequently used).
   Its left menu contains what's not in other components:
   * Apps
   * Metrics scorecards
   * Deployment pipelines
   * Learn - click on a sample to store its assets for that in your workspace, OneLake data hub, and left menu.
   <br /><br />

   ### Install Metrics App

1. Search for other apps for Fabric at

   https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?exp=ubp8&search=fabric&page=1

1. In PowerBI, <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app-install?tabs=1st">install the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app</a> to read:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/capacity/">https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/capacity</a>

1. Click "Get it now" at

   https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/pbi_pcmm.microsoftpremiumfabricpreviewreport?exp=ubp8

1. Click "Install".
1. Click the app to go to it.
1. Connect to your own data by providing a "CapacityID" (GUID) and its UTC_offsite (time zone).

   <a target="_blank" href="https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Developer/How-to-get-Power-BI-Embedded-Capacity-ID/m-p/2942860">PROTIP</a>:
   The capacity ID is shown in the capacity management page within the Power BI service -> Settings > Admin portal -> Capacity settings. Select a Gen2 capacity.
   In the URL of that page is the capacity ID. For example, "9B77CC50-E537-40E4-99B9-2B356347E584" is the Capacity ID in the URL:

   <tt>https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/capacities/9B77CC50-E537-40E4-99B9-2B356347E584</tt>

   You may first have to <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-manage">set your Service Principal as a Capacity Admin</a>.

## Pricing

1. Click "Pricing" to see the Fabric Pricing page:

   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/?country=us

1. Select Region: <strong>East US</strong> (Virginia) in US Dollars by the hour.

   DEFINITION: SKU = Stock Keeping Unit = a unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased in business.

   PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/fjkxm?layout=profile" title="Spreadsheet available for purchase">My analysis, illustrated below</a>, shows that while the number of CUs doubles with each level, costs also double for the two ways of charging:

   <img alt="fabric-cu-pricing-670x388.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701148689/fabric-cu-pricing-670x388_ihqdt8.png">

   Reserved CUs are 41% less than the Pay-as-you-go per-hour prices at all levels, for all countries.

   As for differences in CU Reserved cost among different regions (using different colors):<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701148826/fabric-cu-pricing-intl-394x696_okjmdt.png"><img alt="fabric-cu-pricing-intl-394x696.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701148826/fabric-cu-pricing-intl-394x696_okjmdt.png"></a>

   PROTIP: There is only one "US" entry because prices are the same in all US regions.<br />
   Brazil South is double the cost in the US.
   Fabric may not even be available there because the price for Pay-as-you-go is not listed for it on the website.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smmmE-rjXr8">VIDEO</a>:
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/licenses

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AAeV3bSMso&t=5m6s">VIDEO</a>: A Power BI Pro license is not needed if you have a Fabric Pro license at F64 SKU or above.

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-features

   "Charges for OneLake storage are comparable to Azure ADLS of $0.023/GB on US West 2."

## What's Different?

Rather than other fanboys who say "it's the latest cool thing, let's switch now", let's first clear up some common confusions:

> <a target="_blank" href="https://endjin.com/blog/2023/05/intro-to-microsoft-fabric">BLOG</a>: "Microsoft Fabric can be thought of as the third generation of Microsoft data platforms, where first generation (e.g. HDInsight, SQL Data Warehouse) were somewhat isolated takes on traditional data products; Second generation was Azure Synapse Analytics, which integrated platforms at a UX level but still felt a little disjointed at the data level; and now we have Microsoft Fabric which builds upon the Synapse "unification" vision, with a particular focus on enabling deep data-level interoperability."

The product name "<strong>Fabric</strong>" Microsoft introduced March 2023 along with a set of cloud-based product <strong>experiences</strong> containing the same words also used in legacy products that Microsoft continues to sell: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.casewhen.co/blog/data-factory-showdown-fabric-vs-azure">BLOG</a>:

   * The "Synapse" prefix is now applied to several Fabric products. Before Microsoft Fabric, Microsoft used the "Synapse" brand for <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/sql-synapse-link-overview">Synapse Link</a> and the "Azure Synapse Analytics" product, which Microsoft continues to sell. PROTIP: "<a target="_blank" href="https://endjin.com/blog/2023/05/azure-synapse-analytics-versus-microsoft-fabric-a-side-by-side-comparison">There is no automatic upgrade path"</a> from Azure Synapse Analytics to Fabric Real-Time Analytics.

This "Wordly Map" (from Barry Smart <a target="_blank" href="https://endjin.com/blog/2023/05/azure-synapse-analytics-versus-microsoft-fabric-a-side-by-side-comparison">at Endjin</a>) provides a high-level overview of the evolution of products and features from "Uncharted" to "Industrial" utility in Microsoft Fabric:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701439136/fabric-wardley-map-1121x793_pufd34.webp"><img alt="fabric-wardley-map-1121x793.webp" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701439136/fabric-wardley-map-1121x793_pufd34.webp"></a>

   * The workspace in Azure Synapse Analytics is Synapse Studio GUI. However, Fabric uses a Power BI-based interface organized around <a href="#Personas">personas</a> — data science, data engineering, real-time analytics, etc.

   * "Mapping Data Flows" (and "Synapse Links") are not available in Fabric.

   * "Mapping Data Flows" (and "Synapse Pipelines") are now called "<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-overview">Data Flows</a>" within Data Factory in Fabric.


PROTIP: what is so cool about Microsoft Fabric:
   * <a href="#Shortcuts">OneLake Shortcuts</a> to access any data anywhere
   * <a href="#DeltaFormat">OneLake DeltaFormat</a> for time travel, streaming, and other magic with databases in all formats
   * <a href="#Data+Activator">Data Activator</a>, new to all Microsoft and the industry, for triggering automatic actions
   * Access to Microsoft's CosmosDB multi-region database involves <strong>mirroring</strong>

<a name="Shortcuts"></a>

## OneLake Shortcuts

<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> are the most significant technical advancement with Fabric's "OneLake" capabilities. It's a simple but important feature.

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/using-azure-databricks-with-microsoft-fabric-and-onelake?ft=All%3A">BLOG</a>:
With Shortcuts, Microsoft enables the processing of specific datasets from "anywhere", including blobs (files) in AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage as well as Microsoft's own Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2, Azure Databricks, etc.

Shortcuts enable Data Engineers to create and manage data pipelines that move data from any one place to another.

Behind the scenes, OneLake manages the various permissions and credentials to access data.
Relative file paths can be used to directly read data from shortcuts.
ADLS shortcuts point to the DFS endpoint for the storage account. Example:

   <ul><tt>https://accountname.dfs.core.windows.net/...</tt></ul>

Applications and services outside of Fabric can access Shortcuts through <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-access-api">OneLake's API</a>, using enpoints such as:

   <ul><tt>https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/MyWorkspace/MyLakhouse/Tables/MyShortcut/MyFile.csv</tt></ul>

ADLS and S3 shortcut target paths can contain "-" / "." / "_" / "~" but not <a target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.2">reserved characters in RCF 3986 section 2.2</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701352948/fabric-onelake-shortcuts-1031x632_nszljw.png"><img alt="fabric-onelake-shortcuts-1031x632.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701352948/fabric-onelake-shortcuts-1031x632_nszljw.png"></a>

Shortcuts can be created within Microsoft's various SQL data warehouses, lakehouses, KQL databases, etc.

PROTIP: By themselves, Shortcuts don't "unify data across domains". People do that by actively managing a "unified namespace" of Shortcuts across the entire enterprise. That's hard work requiring both executive and worker support across departments and geographies. Thus the "Chief Data Officer" (CDO).

<a name="DeltaFormat"></a>

## Delta/Parquet Format

Like Adobe's PDF file format, which enabled many companies in the printing industry to flourish due to widespread adoption, the <strong>Delta Lake data format</strong> has enabled the <strong>datalake</strong> industry to achieve a whole new level. Database vendors <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/snowflake/">Snowflake</a> and Databricks have been using the Delta format for years. The storage format used by Microsoft SQL Server format was proprietary.

1. Visit:

   https://www.linkedin.com/company/deltalake/

   Delta Lake is an independent open-source project and not controlled by any single company. To emphasize this we joined the Delta Lake Project in 2019, which is a sub-project of the Linux Foundation Projects.

1. Visit their open-source project at:

   https://github.com/delta-io

   "An open-source <strong>storage framework</strong> that enables building a <a href="#Lakehouse">Lakehouse architecture</a> with compute engines including Spark, PrestoDB, Flink, Trino, and Hive and APIs"

1. Visit their website at:

   https://www.delta.io

   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-intro.html">Delta Lake</a> is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark™ and big data workloads. Delta Lake runs on top of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs.


1. Click the "Lakehouse architecture" link to see the seminal academic paper about that architectural pattern at:

   https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf

   The seminal paper's lead author is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelarmbrust/">Michael Armbrust of Databricks</a> (after a PhD at UC Berkeley).

   Delta Lakehouse data structures are next-level genius:

   * The binary format compresses data (using algorithms Snappy, Gzip, LZ4, etc.) that's 75% than CSV files

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md">Logging of ACID transactions</a> (changes) are enabled by Apache's <strong>"Parquet"</strong> file format, which not only enables auditing governance but also enables <strong>time travel</strong> -- bringing the whole database to specific points back in time. This is similar to what can be done with repositories of text files using Git.

   * Responds to (is fully compatible with) Apache Spark APIs to access data live

   * Share live data without copying to another system

   * Hold structured and unstructured data in the same place

   * Use a "schema-on-read" approach which define tabular schemas on semi-structured data files at the point where the data is read for analysis, without applying constraints when it's stored, rather than legacy "schema-on-write" approach which requires data to be structured before it's stored.

   * Contains metadata that describes the data it contains

   * Contains its own indexing mechanisms

   * multiple queries can write to the same delta table simultaneously (at exactly the same time). <a target="_blank" href="https://books.japila.pl/delta-lake-internals/overview/">BLOG</a>

   * Can handle continuous <strong>streams</strong> of data, processing video, audio, and other media data types

   * Designed to be splittable -- be divided into smaller chunks for parallel processing in distributed computing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.

   PROTIP: The Delta format enables a revolution in how people collaborate because for once there is <strong>a "single source of truth"</strong> for data engineers, data scientists, and business analysts.

   To reiterate, in the future there won't be SSIS ETL jobs creating subsets of data to each remote department.
   Each department accesses the same DataLake.

   ### Lakehouse Architecture

   <a name="Lakehouse"></a>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701404722/lakehouse-gens-1609x654_rey2mo.png"><img alt="lakehouse-gens-1609x654.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701404722/lakehouse-gens-1609x654_rey2mo.png"></a>

   First generation platforms used ETL to Transform and Load data into data warehouses from which analytics reports are created.
   Two-tier architectures still use ETL despite using data lakes referred directly by Machine Learning systems.

   Lakehouse architecture is a data management architecture that combines the analytic capabilities of data warehouses with the scale and flexibility of data lakes to support every known data workload. It is a new paradigm that enables data teams to work with any type of data, build data pipelines in any language, and use any kind of downstream analytics, business intelligence, or machine learning tool.

   Combined with the wide and easy availability of disk space on hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google), data that used to be processed by ETL can now be processed by ELT or ELTL.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comparing-microsoft-fabric-azure-machine-learning-which-kim-berg/">PROTIP</a>:
   Microsoft's legacy <strong>Azure ML</strong> PaaS offering is elevated by Fabric's <strong>Synapse Data Science</strong> SaaS offering by adding access to OneCloud Delta format and the "universal" data preparation, management, and analysis tools that goes with it.

   REMEMBER: Microsoft has renamed the Power BI "dataset" content type to :semantic model". Semantics relates to the study of references, specifically describing the real meaning between symbols or words. A semantic model or semantic data model is a high-level databases. An SDM specification describes a database in terms of the kinds of entities that exist in the application environment, the classifications and groupings of those entities, and the structural interconnections among them.

<a name="Personas"></a>

## Personas (Fabric User Roles)

Now let's focus on <strong>impacts</strong> on the lives of people, before examining the home pages and <strong>capabilities</strong> of the products.

Instead of the traditional generic "Database Administrator" role name,
Microsoft designed Fabric documentation around different roles within enterprises, listed here in order of introduction during a green-field implementation:

### Data Citizens

<strong>Data Citizens</strong> are true end-users -- business people who need to make decisions and take actions based on data.

   They have the budget authority and the responsibility for what are correct values in databases.

   PROTIP: For each set of data, there is one <strong>data owner</strong> who approves data deletion and arranges for audits as well as
   approving who have access and extent of permissions (for implementation by a central security team using IAM tools).

   Data Citizens need to be trained to use <a href="#PowerBI">Power BI</a> for <a href="#Analytics">Analytics</a>, <a href="#Data+Activator">Data Activator</a> for alerts, and other tools provided by Data Analysts. Some track where they spend time on technical aspects to ensure that the time spent is worth the value of the data.

### Data Analysts

<strong>Data (Business) Analysts</strong> serve the needs of Data Citizens by establishing dashboards and alerts, and training users on technologies and possibilities. These Analysts design the "data models" defining relationships among sets of data.

   PROTIP: Business analysts also coordinate <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/chaos-engineering/">Chaos Engineering efforts</a> to ensure that recovery efforts are quick and effective.

   That includes coding <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/kql">KQL (Kusto Query Language)</a> within <a href="#RTA"><strong>Synapse Real Time Analytics</strong></a> to create (star schema) databases for analytics. The product is an evolution of Synapse Data Explorer, but also introduces the "Eventstreams" feature that's very similar to Azure Stream Analytics no-code editor.

   Data Analysts collaborate with Security on using Microsft Purview.

   PROTIP: Those slinging legacy SSIS ETLs can add value now by enabling "Data Citizens" to use PowerBI (and Data Activator) such that they "won't notice" (are impacted minimally) when data inevitably moves from on-prem to the Fabric cloud. Then they can brag on their resume:

   > "Migrated users quickly to Azure Fabric Data Activator automation with minimal disruption due to proactive restructuring of on-prem. SSIS ETLs so users access legacy visualizations and alerts from PowerBI similar to how they view data in cloud Lakehousesxx."


### Data Engineers

<strong>Data Engineers</strong> create databases (platforms):

   * Move data using <a href="#Data+Factory">Data Factory</a>
   * Organize <a href="#Shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> to reference data files within <a href="#OneLake">OneLake storage</a>

   * Program SQL within <a href="#SDW">Synapse Data Warehouse</a> to create traditional relational SQL databases

   * Program PySpark within Synapse Data Engineering to create "big data" (Hadoop-style) <strong>data lakes</strong>

   * Use Data Factory to create data pipelines to move data from one place to another, such as from a data lake to a data warehouse.
   <br /><br />

   Engineers also build automated <strong>workflows</strong> for monitoring, data cleaning, loading, backups, etc.

   PROTIP: In response to security incidents, automation enables complete recreation of capabilities with the latest patches, rather than patching.

   Microsoft's documentation now calls "Power BI administrators" <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/microsoft-fabric-admin">Fabric administrators</a>.

### Data Stewards/Administrators

Database Administrators are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-data-steward"><strong>Data Stewards</strong></a>, <strong>data custodians</strong> responsible for protecting the organization's most treasured assets: its data.

    * Database management
    * Implement Data Security
    * Backups
    * User Access
    * Monitors performance
    <br /><br />

Stewards setup and operate processes for data governance and data quality. They monitor processes for collecting data -- inspecting contents to ensure that data is in the right format. They ensure that app logs, metric collections, database logs shipped, app transactions, snapshots of master data are backed up fully and as scheduled. Once a month they ensure that data can be fully and quickly restored, as measured by RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) SLAs. Such is an important fall-back in case of ransomware attacks.

   Data stewards collaborate with others to detect and solve data corruption or mis-sychronization of data between apps and utilities.

   PROTIP: In many organizations, to limit the impact of credential loss, they, after approval by the data owner, are the only accounts who can <strong>delete data</strong> which others put "in limbo".

   They use <a href="#Purview">Microsoft Purview</a>. QUESTION: Does Microsoft provide all the tools that Data Stewards need?



### Data Scientists

<strong>Data Scientists</strong> work on AI models using Data Science tools such as Notebooks written in PySpark for Machine Learning. The intelligence created can be custom tags that extend generic LLM (Large Language Models) created by others for NLP (Natural Language Processing) and other AI (Artificial Intelligence) capabilities.

Data Scientists use Synapse Data Science to add embedding tags within vector databases to enhance LLMs with custom data.


### Additional roles:

* Solution Architects/Architects
* AI Engineers/Architects
* Power BI data analysts
* ETL developers
* Information architects
* DevOps Engineers/Architects

* Managers & Supervisors
* Executives: CEO, CTO, CMO, CRO, etc.
<br /><br />

The above are used as the basis to assign permissions to the Fabric "experiences" (sub-products).

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.casewhen.co/blog/data-factory-showdown-fabric-vs-azure">IMPORTANT PROTIP</a>: Some use the term "<strong>Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric (DFiMF)</strong>" to differentiate it from the legacy ADF. DFiMF adds to ADF features from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.casewhen.co/blog/data-analysis-and-data-transformation-with-power-query-in-power-bi">Power Query Dataflows</a> and integrates tagging for Data Governance. DEFINITION: Azure Data Factory is a service that can ingest large amounts of raw, unorganized data from relational and non-relational systems, and convert this data into meaningful information. Therefore, it's referred to as a data integration service.


1. Data Factory: data integration <strong>pipelines</strong> to copy data and orchestrate data processing, combining <strong>Power Query Online</strong> and/or Dataflows (Gen2) to Import and transform data from 90+ data sources, and load it directly into a table in the lakehouse.
Dataflows (Gen2) performs ETL tasks using Power Query Online.

1. <a href="#Data+Activator">Data Activator</a>: "Insight to action" takes action based on real-time changes in your data.

   For example, if a trigger activates when a trend reaches a pre-defined threshold, if action is not urgent, look up people using <a target="_blank" href="https://mgt.dev/">Microsoft Graph Toolkit Playground</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.m365princess.com/blogs/microsoft-graph-people-picker-power-apps/">lookalike</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPRzHbMzoI0">identify when they can meet</a>. Then use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWdXiMzA-c">Power Apps</a> to populate meeting picker, identify meeting slots, and create an event. Add calls (actions) to a Power Apps custom connector that will be called from your canvas app. Schedule a Teams meeting in canvas app within Teams. Automatically send out a meeting invitation.

NOTE: Previously, Azure Synapse Pipelines had a
   * Schedule Trigger,
   * Tumbling Window Trigger, and
   * Event-Based Trigger.
   <br /><br />

Data Activator monitors workspaces with a PowerBI Premium license.

Data Activator initiates actions based on <strong>Reflex items</strong>, each containing all the details to connect to data sources, monitor conditions. A Reflex is typically setup for each business segment or process monitored.

   PROTIP: <strong>Data Activator</strong>, if it works as intended, can be a real <strong>game changer</strong> to enable <strong>Data Citizens</strong> to create "digital robots" that automatically <strong>take action</strong> rather than relying on humans constantly scanning dashboards, which can be error prone. Here's where machines (AI or not) replace human workers -- and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CPoXDrwPP8">"The Sorcerer's Apprentice"</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcesnqVF0us&t=1m39s">VIDEO: fiasco</a> becomes reality.

Data Activator runs in the background to review data created in Power BI, Synapse Real Time Analytics, Synapse Data Warehouse in OneLake to identify conditions that trigger automatic actions (in batches every 5 minutes):
   * send message in Microsoft Teams,
   * send appointment in Outlook, and
   * Power Automate to perform logic

By leveraging AI capabilities, Copilot streamlines and automates data-related tasks, enabling users to work more efficiently and derive actionable insights from their data.

   The <strong>Fabric engine</strong> is an upgrade from separate systems used by separate roles of people.
   So there is a lot of copying of data from one engine to another<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-fabric-explained-for-existing-synapse-users?ft=Synapse:category">:</a>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701048036/ADLSg2-lakehouse-864x291_d8wv2o.png"><img alt="ADLSg2-lakehouse-864x291.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1701048036/ADLSg2-lakehouse-864x291_d8wv2o.png"></a>


### Delta (Parquet) Format

At the bottom is storage. "<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview">One Lake</a>" is the branding for storage built on top of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLSg2) lakehouse that combines storage locations across different regions and clouds into a single logical lake, without moving or duplicating data (DirectLake mode).

The key enabler (for Microsoft as well as Snowflake and Databricks DeltaLake) is the <strong>Delta format</strong> (generically called "Parquet" format) that enables <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-core-data-concepts/5-transactional-data-processing">ACID transactions</a> on "unstructured" data in data lakes:

   * Atomicity – each transaction is treated as a single unit, which succeeds completely or fails completely. For example, a transaction that involved debiting funds from one account and crediting the same amount to another account must complete both actions. If either action can't be completed, then the other action must fail.

   * Consistency – transactions can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another. To continue the debit and credit example above, the completed state of the transaction must reflect the transfer of funds from one account to the other.

   * Isolation – concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state. For example, while the transaction to transfer funds from one account to another is in-process, another transaction that checks the balance of these accounts must return consistent results - the balance-checking transaction can't retrieve a value for one account that reflects the balance before the transfer, and a value for the other account that reflects the balance after the transfer.

   * Durability – when a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed. After the account transfer transaction has completed, the revised account balances are persisted so that even if the database system were to be switched off, the committed transaction would be reflected when it is switched on again.

Previously, SQL and analytic data are stored in different database technologies.
