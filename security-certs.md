Its $550 plus a Maintenance Fee of $250/2 year. It assesses knowledge of U.S. privacy laws and regulations and legal requirements for transferring sensitive personal data to/from the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions.

Upon passing your exam, you will need to purchase a Certification Maintenance Fee to activate your certification, and again for each two-year certification term.

For IAPP members, the fee is built into membership benefits.
Non-member test takers are encouraged to purchase the Certification Maintenance Fee at the time of exam purchase so it will activate automatically upon passing the exam.

## Real World Penetration Testing

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_Pgk0v72UY">VIDEO</a>:
https://cp.tc (Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition) provides for college students a "real-world" enterprise environment. Seeing how such environments are constructed is an education in itself.
CPTC is unlike "CTF (capture the flag)" competitions which are focused on technical aspects,
the culmination of CPTC is focused on the "real world" aspects of security such as where writing a report to corporate managers about both vulnerabilities and their mitigation.

## CCSK

<a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/ccsk/">The Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)</a> is marketed as a complement to other credentials (CCAK, CISA, CISSP, CCSP) by the Seattle-based <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/">Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)</a> which also markets <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/#_ccsk">training</a>.

QUESTION: The CSA <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/ctpd">Cloud Trust Protocol Daemon protoype</a> is inactive?

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.whizlabs.com/learn/course/ccsk-pt/">
Whizlabs has sample tests</a> but questionable quality with too many double negative questions and answers.

The CCSK is an <strong>open-book, online exam</strong>, completed in 90 minutes. Purchasing the exam costs $395 (free to veterans) for two test attempts, which you will have 2 years to use. The minimum passing score is 80% of the 60 multiple-choice vendor-neutral questions selected randomly from the CCSK question pool in v4 of the exam available December 1, 2017:

   * 6% are based on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-riskassessment">2009 Cloud Computing report</a> from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.enisa.europa.eu/">ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency)</a>

   * 7% are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/cloud-controlsmatrix-v3-0-1/">CSAâ€™s CCM (Cloud Controls Matrix) spreadsheet 3.0.1</a> which cross references the many other standard worldwide (AICPA, PIPEDA, CIS, COBIT, CSA, ENISA, FedRAMP, GAAP, HIPPA, HITRUST, IEC, NIST, PCI, etc.). It is the basis for CSA's <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/consensus-assessments/">Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)</a> industry-accepted way to document which security controls exist in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services, which inputs to <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/">"Level 1" of the STAR (CSA Security Trust Assurance and Risk)</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/">Registry</a> of vendors.

   * 87% are based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4/">CSA Guidance v4</a> at PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/CSA-Guidance">https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/CSA-Guidance</a> -- a masterwork providing a summary of terms and concepts which integrate the various worldwide standards.

### CISSP

<img align="right" alt="CISSP-logo- Square-131x131" width="131" height="131" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/116986846-8531d800-ac8b-11eb-83af-651083c07bb3.png">
Even at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam/ISC2-Exam-Pricing">$749 USD</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP">Certified Information Systems Security Professional exam</a> (pronouced "sis pee") is a sought-after technical certification in cybersecurity leaders as the "gold standard" of vendor-neutral cybersecurity certifications. Earning it proves you understand cybersecurity from a management viewpoint -â€” a requirement if your organization is subject to PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, ISO 27001, or other regulations.

The first version of the CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) was finalized in 1992 and the CISSP credential was launched in 1994.
Since it's an internationally recognized, there are questions about cybersecurity regulations in Canada, UK, EU, etc.

Rather than the previous 250 questions over 6 hourse, the CISSP exam is now <strong>adaptive</strong>, asking 100-150 questions, depending on whether answers are correct.
PROTIP: With Adaptive Testing, your objective is to get hard questions. So study as if you'll get all hard questions. The better you are, the harder the test is. If you aced the first 10 questions, you'll be put into "brutal mode".
With CAT (Computer Adaptive Testing), the more one aces every question, the quicker she would get done before the 3 hours.
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nqqL1rjIY4">VIDEO</a>:
This also means you won't be able to go back and change answers in previous questions answered.

There is a 5 year experience requirement, attested by other professionals after you pass the exam.

The CISSP has 3 different <strong>concentrations</strong>:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/issap">ISSAP</a> = Architecture
   1. Architect for Governance, Compliance and Risk Management
   2. Security Architecture Modeling
   3. Infrastructure Security Architecture
   4. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Architecture
   5. Architect for Application Security
   6. Security Operations Architecture
   <br /><br />

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/issap">ISSEP</a> = Engineering
   1. Systems Security Engineering Foundations
   2. Risk Management
   3. Security Planning and Design
   4. Systems Implementation, Verification and Validation
   5. Secure Operations, Change Management and Disposal
   <br /><br />

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/issmp">ISSMP</a> = Management Professional
   1. Leadership and Business Management
   2. Systems Lifecycle Management
   3. Risk Management
   4. Threat Intelligence and Incident Management
   5. Contingency Management
   6. Law, Ethics, and Security Compliance Management
   <br /><br />

You need to pass at least 70% on <em>each</em> CISSP domain.

   PROTIP: I found his native-sounding English excellent.
   I think his <a target="_blank" href="https://studynotesandtheory.mykajabi.com/products/study-notes-and-theory-a-cissp-study-guide">videos</a>, flash cards, and practice questions are worth the $49 per month (less when buying for a year) because his focus is on how to study and remember content for the exam. He helps by providing memorable conceptual hooks.
   He is the only one I know who compares differences between content in Shon Harris 7th vs. Sybex books.
   He provides detailed analysis of why each answer is correct or not.
   But I can do without the 10 seconds of intro music each module.
   And it's annoying to have to reset speed and quality every module.

> I think ISC2 is too clever with their questions, past the point of making the test as much about knowing the twisted mind of the test maker rather than understanding the underlying material. I wich that ISC2 test writers see "Advanced" level of "knowledge" as higher order thinking (such as evaluation) rather than teasing out twisted meaning of words in tests.

   * PEN-200 <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/">Kali Linux</a> class to prep for $495 OSCP (Certified Professional) is one of the most difficult to pass because it is part "hazing ritual" and part proctored via webcam. It is a 24-hour time-boxed test where you penetrate of as many machines as you can within a massive virtual environment (which includes Active Directory), using Kali Linux. That's followed by another 24-hour time frame to write (with screenshots) an exam report. You must also pass a background check. The PWK prep course is $1,295. <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@anuragmewar/how-not-to-fail-oscp-on-your-first-attempt-ad-special-b0819523e3">More</a>

## CompTIA

So compliance with <a target="_blank" href="https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/">DoD 8570-2005</a> retired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/08/dod-directive-814001-cyberspace-workforce-management">NIST DoD Directive 8140.01</a> means job candidates need to have passed to it to just apply for some government jobs. DoD 8140 expands on DoD 8570 to leverage the <a target="_blank" href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Cyber-Workforce/DCWF.aspx">Defense Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (DCWF)</a>, which draws from the original <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework-resource-center">National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)</a> and DoD Joint Cyberspace Training and Certification Standards (JCT&CS).

CompTIA certifications were designed for compliance with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the US DoD to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation, because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 2.3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.

### Security+

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">Security+ exam SY0-601 at comptia.org/certifications/security</a>
is described an "entry level" exam. But its detailed coverage of some obscure encryption protocols and tricky questions make it difficult even for professionals.

NOTE: I first answered over <strong>75% the 90-question</strong> Security+ March 2020 after studying literally 4 years, on and off. I held off due to its <a target="_blank" href="https://store.comptia.org/comptia-security-plus-exam-voucher/p/SEC-601-TSTV-20-C">$392 test fee</a> plus annual renewal fees.
PROTIP: They offer a <a target="_blank" href="https://store.comptia.org/comptia-store-club/p/ITPR-0020-ANNS-2019">$49 annual Club</a> for a $78 discount (20% off all CompTIA products). Students get a 40% discount at a different website.

What helped me get over the intimidation is to seek out the <strong>trick questions and delight in them</strong> as an intellectual curiosity.
