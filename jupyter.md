<i>{{ page.excerpt }}</i>
{% include l18n.html %}
{% include _toc.html %}

The name "Jupyter" comes from the combination of languages Julia, Python, and R (the statistics package).

{% include whatever.html %}

Jupyter is a <strong>web application server</strong> that runs several 
separate environments (one on each port). It's open-sourced at:
<ul><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git">https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git</a></ul>

Each Jupyter notebook contains explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations, all in one easily <strong>sharable</strong> document.

Notebooks used to be called "iPython" notebooks before languages other than Python were added.

Internally, Jupyter Notebooks are <strong>JSON formatted</strong> files with the extension <strong>.ipynb</strong>. However, ".txt" is sometimes added for storage within older systems.
   * PyCharm lets you right-click a Python file and convert it to notebook format.
   * To covnert .ipynb json to Python code, ???
   * To run Python code
   <br /><br />
Below is a guided learning experience.
You perform actions in a planned sequence that takes you through various features.
"PROTIP" tags commentary to highlight ideas probably unique to this website.

## Superceded by Marimo

Many have switched to Marimo, is reactive and keeps all cells in sync like in other spreadsheets.

<hr />

## Cloud Environments

If all you have is a Chromebook or Raspberry Pi micro, you can still program by accessing cloud-based enviornments:

   * Google's Colab (Colaboratory)</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/jupyter-notebook-101">Kaggle</a>
   * AWS

<hr />

<a name="Colab"></a>

### Cloud Google Colab (Colaboratory)

Google provides a FREE on-line environment with zero configuration:

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com">https://colab.research.google.com</a>

<img width="1436" height="1216" alt="python-colab-welcome-1436x1216" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136654704-a53200b7-32d7-475d-9964-6dba7a3ecf85.png">

In the above example, data is received from the numpy (np) library's random function, rounded down.

<hr />

### Hands-on Photo Style Transfer

There are other tools that do this.
But as a practical example of learning about Colab for programming Python Machine Learning, 
let's do a "style transfer" on a photo file <strong>you provide</strong>:

1. Click on this link to open the "TF-Hub: Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles.ipynb" within Colab:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb</a>

1. To <strong>Run all</strong> Notebook cells: on a Mac, hold down command + fn to press the "F9".

   For a reminder of that keyboard sequence, click the "Runtime" menu.

1. Press (command+down arrow) to scroll down to the bottom to see the default original, style image, and stylized image:

   ![python-style-transfer-1178x410](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136674720-b24e8620-04e8-4d50-bf01-2e6ac002f70f.png)

1. Scroll down past the list of style images and click on each URL to view them.

   The program creates a stylized image for each entry in the "content_url" dictionary.

1. Click the content_name: <strong>sea_turtle</strong> to select another original image.
1. Click the style_name: <strong>munch_scream</strong> to select another style image.

   ### Style Transfer your picture's URL

1. To run the code block:
   * click on the rounded arrow or 
   * Press the Tab key then hold down Shift key to press Return.
   <br /><br />

1. At the left menu, click "To Run: Load more images" to see where you can add a statement pointing to your own photo.

1. Click on this URL, to go to many websites go to get a URL of a photo based on an email:
   
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.gravatar.com/">en.gravatar.com</a>
   
1. Sign in using your WordPress email and password, or sign up and download your photo.
1. Right-click on the picture you want to use and select <strong>Copy image address</strong>.
1. Click on the "TF-Hub" tab to return to the Colab.

1. Replace the "grace_hopper" entry with the URL to your picture, for example:

   <pre>grace_hopper='https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/10217204/6f0736298461c359b864b3939db37f8f.jpg',
   </pre>

1. To <strong>Run all</strong> Notebook cells: on a Mac, hold down command + fn to press the "F9".

1. Select a different style_name and rerun to see a new stylized image.
1. When you see a stylized image you like, right-click on the picture and Save Image As... download.jpg in your Downloads folder:
   
   <img width="1013" alt="jupyter-amadeo-2026x698" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300046/136677101-fcc3dc9c-0620-4bc3-91c6-3146c424bafb.png">

   Admittedly, the pictures are not high resolution.

1. Now edit that picture and share it.


### Sample Notebook files in Colab

Navigate to a URL containing Jupyter Notebook files:

* Sample Notebook code with "Open in Colab" are in Noah Gift's "Minimal Python" book:
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/paiml/minimal-python/blob/master/Chapter1_Minimal_Python.ipynb">https://github.com/paiml/minimal-python/blob/master/Chapter1_Minimal_Python.ipynb</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook">https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~boncelet/ipython.html">https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~boncelet/ipython.html</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/odewahn/ipynb-examples">https://github.com/odewahn/ipynb-examples</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ogrisel/notebooks">https://github.com/ogrisel/notebooks</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html">
   analysis of gravitational waves from two colliding blackholes detected</a>
   by the LIGO experiment. 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5892be63_sentiment-network/sentiment-network.zip">
   Sentiment-network.zip</a> from 
   Andrew Trask contains notebooks for sentiment analysis.

### Browser configuration on your laptop

For possible offline access (on a cruise ship, a railcar through the wilderness, at the beach, etc.):

1. PROTIP: Set Chrome as your default browser.

   REMEMBER: Jupyter's <a href="#CommandPalette">Command Palette</a> does not work in Firefox and Internet Explorer, only in Chrome and Apple Safari.

   ### Jupyter notebook and session files

1. Make a container folder (directory) to hold Jupyter <strong>session files</strong>. 

   This is done automatically by doing a git clone.

1. Download a Jupyter Notebook file into your folder.

   You may have to move downloaded files from your Downloads folder.

   ### Ignore checkpoints on push

1. Edit the <tt>.gitignore</tt> file to add <tt>.ipynb_checkpoints/</tt> so that such folders created automatically are not uploaded into the GitHub repository.

1. <a href="#RunNotebook">run a notebook</a>.

## Server Installation

The canonical <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.org/install">https://jupyter.org/install</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html">Installation Guide</a> says
JupyterLab can be <a href="#ManualInsta">manually installed using conda or pip, described below</a>.

However, you will find it easier to use the Docker image defined at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks">https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks</a>. See <a target="_blank" href="
https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html">https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html</a>

Even better, the easiest approach is to use my Bash script at bash/bash-sample.sh

   https://github.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps 

<hr />

<a name="jax"></a>

### jax

tbd.

<a name="jupytext"></a>

### jupytext

* To create a .ipynb file based on the name of your .py file:
   ```
   pip install jupytext
   jupytext --to notebook your_script.py
   ```

   See https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-cli.html

   This creates the .ipynb file and for an additional bonus keep it synchronized to the .py file:
   ```
   jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py your_script.ipynb --sync
   ```

* To convert to .ipynb within a Python program, use William James Handley's py2nb library (https://github.com/williamjameshandley/py2nb):
   ```
   import py2nb
   py2nb.convert('your_script.py')
   ```

* This converts "main comments" (i.e. starting with '#' and no leading space) to MarkDown cells, and assigned each function definition to a dedicated cell. 
   ```
   pip install p2j
   p2j your_script.py
   ```

<a name="ipykernel"></a>

## ipykernel

For a newer but more complex user interface to jupyter notebook:

<tt><strong>python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3
jupyter lab
</strong></tt>


<a name="Runipy"></a>

## Runipy

On a Mac:
1. git clone the repo containing an .ipynb file.

1. To install the server:

   <pre><strong>uv pip install runipy</strong></pre>

1. Run a script using runipy:

   <pre><strong>runipy -o MyNotebook.ipynb</strong></pre>

   <tt>-o</tt> saves the output of each cell back to the notebook file.

   Alternately, generate a HTML report:

   <pre><strong>runipy MyNotebook.ipynb --html report.html</strong></pre>

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/runipy


### nbconvert

1. Use the command that comes with jupyter server to open the notebook, execute it, capture new output, and save the result in mynotebook.nbconvert.ipynb:

   <tt><strong>jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute mynotebook.ipynb --output mynotebook.ipynb</strong></tt>

   Alternately, to continue execution despite exceptions:

   <tt>jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --allow-errors --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=180 mynotebook.ipynb</tt> 

   --inplace

1. For more:

   http://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-notebook 


<a name="ManualInsta"></a>
<a name="JupyterLab"></a>

### Local Jupyter lab

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to run .ipynb files, such as:

   <tt>github_wilsonmar/python-samples</tt>

1. On a Mac: if you use pipenv, install using that. Otherwise:

   <pre><strong>uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install jupyterlab
   </strong></pre>
   
   This adds a bunch of "jupyter" files in the <tt>/bin</tt> folder.
   
1. In a Terminal window

   <pre><strong>jupyter lab</strong></pre>

   The command opens a tab in the default internet browser to:

   <tt>http://localhost:8888/lab</tt>

1. To shut down the server, on the Terminal CLI, press control + C twice.


### Config

1. Edit <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> to make sure the <tt>/bin</tt> folder is in the PATH.

   <pre>export PATH="$PATH:/bin"  # for /bin/jupyter</pre>

   One may already be there for other apps.

   <a name="AfterInsta"></a>

   ### After install: Add themes

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes">https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes</a>

   ### Use within VSCode

   Jupyter works great within VSCode.

   See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks



   <a name="JupyterNotebook"></a>

### Start Jupyter GUI server

1. To run a specific .pynb file:

   <pre><strong>jupyter notebook --port 8888 notebook1.ipynb
   </strong></pre>

   A "&" is added to the end of the command above to run the server in background 
   so that additional bash commands can execute (such as identifying the process number and cleaning up after <a href="#Shutdown">shutdown</a>).

   The command above creates a (hidden) file <strong>.jupyter</strong> in your home folder, invokes a web server locally, and automatically pops up to your default browser a tab with url:

   http://localhost:8888/tree

   Alternately, to start without a web browser:

   <pre>jupyter notebook --no-browser</pre>

   The command response briefly shows a process number:

   <pre>[1] 2809</pre>

   If the command is run again on another Terminal, additional Notebook servers are invoked with the port number incremented from 8888.


   <a name="Shutdown"></a>

   ### Shutdown jupyter server

   If the server was started in background, you can't shutdown the server from Terminal by pressing control + C twice. You would need to run (such as):
   
   <pre><strong>kill -9 2809</strong></pre>

<hr />

<a name="RunNotebook"></a>

## Run Notebook UI

<a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html">
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html</a>

1. If Jupyter was started without specifying a Notebook file, you would see a tree listing.

1. Click a link to a <tt>.ipynb</tt> (Notebook) file listed, to see it's code.

1. PROTIP: You can press the "Run" icon to run a single step. However,
those familiar with the file can press the ">>" button to run all <strong>cells (steps)</strong> in the file.

   Each invocation opens a new browser window.

   <a name="CommandPalette"></a>

   ### Keyboard Command Palette of shortcuts
   
   NOTE: This does not work in Firefox and Internet Explorer,
   only in Chrome and Apple Safari.
