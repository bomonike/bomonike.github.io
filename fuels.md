<a name="#SolarOvens"></a>

## Solar Oven

Unlike other fuels which are depleated, the sun shines unless its cloudy.

When the sun is shining, concentrating reflections of the sun's rays can heat up to 400 degrees, enough to bake a cake.

PROTIP: Warm up a black bladder or even rocks during the day for a warm water bottle at night.


<a name="SolarPanels"></a>

## Solar Panels

Charge up batteries durng the day.

PROTIP: Open south-facing curtains during the day to let in sun, then close them at night with thermal drapes to trap warmth. This is entirely free once set up.​

PROTIP: Bluetti Salt-based batteries do not degrade in cold climates like Lithium Batteris.


<a name="ManualCrank"></a>

## Manual Crank

Hand-Crank or Dynamo Lights obtain power from manual motion.
   One minute of cranking can provide several minutes of light. They are good for backup or travel kits.

Foot operated dynamos enable exercise which generates more body heat as well.


<a name="Conservation"></a>

## Conservation of heat

Modern homes (especially in Germany and Nordic countries) are built as an enclosed Spacer
with a heat and air exchanger. Heat generation is outside of that enclosure.

To conserve heat indoors:
   * Wear layers in winter.
   * Insulate: Hang heavy blankets over windows/doors/walls
   * Caulk windows and doors.
   * Heat just a single room to live in (a tent in the room).
   <br /><br />

To conserve heat outdoors:
   * Build a fire next to a bolder or over rocks which radiate heat overnight.
   * Carry low-weight "emergency blankets" to reflect heat back to your body.
   * Carry heavier-weight fire blankets
   <br /><br />


<a name="Carbon"></a>

## Carbon dioxcide

All the following fuels generate heat from burning, which creates Carbon Dioxide, which 
can cause death if not ventilated. But ventilation also lets heat escape.

<a name="#Firewood"></a>

## FireWood

An open fire at a campsite is a great place for conversation as hold hot dogs or smores on a stick.

Smoke is a nusiance, especially when wet wood or sap-laden wood is burning.

But open fires are not always allowed when surrounding vegetation is dry and prone to forest fires.
An open fire doesn't give you the control of a dedicated wood camp stove.

Firewood are commonly available for purchase from gas stations and many stores for $____.

Cutting wood with an ax takes energy, and can be dangerous.
The $__ wood splitter is a safer way to split small pieces of wood.

Wood is not reliably available. The availability of dry wood depends on your location and weather. Most busy campsites restrict gathering of wood. So always check ahead with the Forest Service or the proper authority where you're going.

To find wood in a forest, look for dead trees.

Firewood fires need to be replenished every hour.

Buy wood pellet fireplaces designed to burn continously without replenishments.

The $__ portable stove burns dry wood sticks, about the diameter of a thumb to <strong>charges your cell phone</strong>.
It's also packable.


<a name="Alcohol"></a>

## Grain Alcohol

VIDEO: Grain alcohol stoves can be made out of a 12oz beer or soda can.

Alcohol burns very clean.

Many backpackers may carry an alcohol stove as a backup to their primary stove.

But alcohol used to flambe cherries burn at a relatively low temperature.

<strong>Denatured alcohol</strong> is the preferred fuel for alcohol stoves
It has the highest percentage of alcohol to water ratio, like 90%.

$__ per __oz. purchased at the hardware store burns for __ hours.

"everclear" (Pure ethanol) can be purchased at a liquor store and used in an alcohol stove. 

"Rubbing alcohol" can be used but doesn't burn as clean as denatured alcohol or pure ethanol.


<a name="WhiteGas"></a>

## White Liqud Gas

At $__ per __oz, White liquid gas is more affordable than propane bottles.

A canister to hold it are

White Gas stoves work by using a non-pressurized liquid fuel (opposed to a pressurized fuel like Propane). 

It is burnt by a stove such as the $__ Firefly, one of the most lightweight of stoves.
The stove comes with a <strong>manual pump</strong> to provide pressure to the fuel system.
While this is <strong>extra work</strong>, it allow this type of stove to work in even extremely cold weather. So it's an option for highly experienced adventurers.

However, it can be messy and potentially dangerous due to the handling of the fuel.

White gas doesn't contain additives that are in other liquid fuels like automotive gasoline or kerosene, so it burns very cleanly.




<a name="Candles"></a>

## Candles

$__ tea light candles are less than an inch of wax, but can boil water in a kettle put on top of a pie pan.

$__ Catholic prayer candles in glass burn for ___ hours.

Group several candles under a terracotta pot to create a mini radiant heater. This works by trapping and slowly releasing heat into the room—cheap, simple, and good for emergency use.​

<a name="Gasoline"></a>

## Gasoline

Gasoline is dangerous to store, requiring well-ventilated place that's kept cool all year.

Gasoline is made smelly because volatile compounds are toxic to people and animals.

Plastic carriers leak 
$75 Jerry cans from WWII leak

The Ethanol corrodes small engines.

Gasoline degrades over time, 
For storage up to 9 months,
buy each __oz bottle of $__ Sta-bilt stablizes __gallons of gasoline.

Instead of filling up your car and going,
you need to fill up your car from handling bottles.
Such hassle takes discipline to maintain.


<a name="Kerosene"></a>

## Kerosene

Kerosene fuel remains stable without treatment.

It's also smelly. 

Although not as common, kerosene is another type of fuel that can be used in specific camping stoves, sometimes requiring a modification to the stove to do so.

Kerosene can be found almost anywhere and is inexpensive, and may be considered for remote traveling adventures.

However, kerosene produces more smoke with odor, and emits more volatile byproducts compared to white Gas. Additionally, the sooty residue that's produced when burning kerosene can be difficult to clean and may affect the performance of your stove.

<a name="Propane"></a>

## Propane

Compact kerosene or propane heaters (like the Mr. Buddy type) are effective for small rooms and are relatively cheap to run. They use liquid fuel rather than electricity, and modern models include automatic shut-off and oxygen sensors for safety. Always ventilate and follow safety precautions.​

## Lamp Oil

    "A single lamp can run for 258 hours on just one gallon of oil."

    Some claim "long burning".

Propane is one of the most popular fuels used for camping and camp stoves.

It holds a very vapor high pressure compared to other fuel types, including at very low temperatures. This makes it a great performing fuel and an excellent fuel choice for most situations.

Camp stove propane cylinders can be purchased in many big-box, outdoor, hardware, and grocery stores.

Many propane camp stoves are more suitable for car camping as the stoves and fuel canisters are often larger and heavier than canisters used for compact backpacking stoves.


<a name="Butane"></a>

## Butane

Asian restaurants use Butane stoves because the fuel burns clean, with no smell.

Although in most cases, Butane fuel will perform adequately for camp cooking needs, in more extreme cases (like very cold temperatures or prolonged usage) it can lose pressure more easily. Isobutane is a variant of Butane that can hold a higher vapor pressure, making it a better performing fuel.


* <a href="#JetBoil">JetBoil</a>
<a name="JetBoil"></a>

## JetBoil

The $__ Jetboil Genesis Basecamp stove MicroMo cooking system is the most lightweight and reliable.

It's popular for backpacking because the fuel canisters it uses is more lightweight compared to propane canisters because it contain "Isobutane", a special mix of propane and butane
that combines cold-weather performance of propane with the lower pressure of isobutane. This allows the fuel to be stored in a much lighter weight canister compared to Propane, which requires a very heavy steel cylinder to contain its high pressure.

The proprietary "JetPower" fuel canisters are available in sporting goods stores, not most gas stations.
At $__ per 450G bottle runs for ___ hours.

Many propane/isobutane canisters are recyclable. 
Get the $__ Jetboil CrunchIt tool to puncture the canister before disposal and recycling.
