AP Statistics is College Board's most popular exam.

https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-Statistics

AP® Statistics gives students hands-on experience collecting, analyzing, graphing, and interpreting real-world data. They will learn to effectively design and analyze research studies by reviewing and evaluating real research examples taken from daily life. The next time they hear the results of a poll or study, they will know whether the results are valid. As the art of drawing conclusions from imperfect data and the science of real-world uncertainties, statistics plays an important role in many fields. The equivalent of an introductory college-level course, AP® Statistics prepares students for the AP exam and for further study in science, sociology, medicine, engineering, political science, geography, and business.

## Skill Categories:

A. Selecting Statistical Methods = Select methods for collecting and/or analyzing data for statistical
inference.
B. Data Analysis = Describe patterns, trends, associations, and relationships in data.
C. Using Probability and Simulation =  to describe probability distributions and define uncertainty in statistical inference. Explore random phenomena.
D. Statistical Argumentation = Develop an explanation or justify a conclusion using evidence from data,
definitions, or statistical inference. Use statistical reasoning to draw appropriate conclusions and justify claims.

https://praxis.ets.org/test/5165.html
The Praxis test for Mathematics by ETS is $130.00
   span the secondary mathematics curriculum including content related to (I) Number & Quantity and Algebra, (II) Functions and Calculus, (III) Geometry, and (IV) Statistics & Probability. A full list of the mathematics topics covered is provided in Content Topics. Test takers will find that approximately 25 percent of the questions call for application of mathematics within a teaching scenario or an instructional task.

   159 is roughly the same as getting 59% right.
